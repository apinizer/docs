A Project is an organizational unit in the Apinizer platform where API Proxies and related resources are logically grouped. Projects are used to organize APIs, provide access control, and enable collaboration.

## The Project Concept

A Project is a logical container used by different teams within an organization to organize and manage different APIs. Each project contains its own API Proxies, policies, connections, and settings.

## Project Features

### Project Contents

A project can contain:

* **API Proxies**: All API Proxies belonging to the project
* **Policies**: Project-specific policy definitions
* **Connections**: Database, message queue, etc. connections
* **Connectors**: Integration connectors
* **Variables**: Project-level variables
* **Settings**: Project-specific configurations

### Project Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a Project">
    When creating a new project, the following information is defined:
    
    * **Project Name**: Unique name identifying the project
    * **Description**: Purpose and scope of the project
    * **Members**: Users with access to the project and their roles
    * **Visibility**: Project visibility settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Project Members and Roles">
    Each project can have members with different roles:
    
    * **Project Manager**: Authority to manage the project
    * **Developer**: Authority to create and edit API Proxies
    * **Viewer**: View-only authority
    
    These roles provide project-based access control.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Project Visibility">
    Projects can have different visibility levels:
    
    * **Public**: All users can see
    * **Private**: Only project members can see
    * **Organization**: Users within the organization can see
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Project and Environment Relationship

Projects and environments are different concepts:

* **Project**: Logical organizational unit (which APIs work together?)
* **Environment**: Physical/resource unit (where do APIs run?)

API Proxies in a project can be deployed to different environments:

```
Project: E-Commerce APIs
├─ Development Environment
│  ├─ Product API v1.0
│  └─ Order API v1.0
├─ Test Environment
│  ├─ Product API v1.1
│  └─ Order API v1.1
└─ Production Environment
   ├─ Product API v1.2
   └─ Order API v1.2
```

## Project Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team-Based Organization" icon="users">
    Different teams working in their own projects. For example:
    * E-Commerce Team → E-Commerce Project
    * Payment Team → Payment Project
    * Reporting Team → Reporting Project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customer-Based Organization" icon="building">
    Separate projects for different customers. For example:
    * Customer A → Customer A Project
    * Customer B → Customer B Project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product-Based Organization" icon="box">
    Separate projects for different products. For example:
    * Mobile Application → Mobile API Project
    * Web Application → Web API Project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version-Based Organization" icon="code-branch">
    Separate projects for different API versions. For example:
    * API v1 → API v1 Project
    * API v2 → API v2 Project
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Project Operations

### Project Export/Import

Projects can be exported and moved to other environments or systems:

* **Export**: Exporting all project content in JSON/YAML format
* **Import**: Importing an exported project to another environment or system
* **Cross-Environment Migration**: Moving projects between different environments

### Project Templates

Frequently used project configurations can be saved as templates and used when creating new projects.
