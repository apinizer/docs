An API Proxy is a core component of the Apinizer platform. It is a layer that sits in front of backend APIs and provides functions such as security, traffic management, message transformation, validation, and enrichment.

## What is an API Proxy?

An API Proxy is an intermediary layer that receives requests from clients, applies various policies to these requests, and then routes them to backend APIs. By sitting in front of backend APIs, it provides API management and security functions from a central point.

## How Does an API Proxy Work?

### Request Flow

```
Client
   │
   ▼ (HTTPS Request)
┌─────────────┐
│ API Proxy   │ ← Policy Enforcement Point
│             │
│ 1. Security │ (Authentication, authorization)
│ 2. Validation│ (Message validation, schema check)
│ 3. Transformation│ (Format transformation)
│ 4. Enrichment│ (Header addition, data addition)
│ 5. Routing│ (Routing to backend)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼ (Backend API Request)
   Backend API
```

### Response Flow

```
Backend API
   │
   ▼ (Response)
┌─────────────┐
│ API Proxy   │
│             │
│ 1. Transformation│ (Format transformation)
│ 2. Masking│ (Sensitive data masking)
│ 3. Logging │ (Transaction logging)
│ 4. Response │ (Response to client)
└──────┬──────┘

## Creating an API Proxy

When creating an API Proxy, the following steps are followed:

1. **API Definition**: Import from OpenAPI/Swagger or WSDL file
2. **Routing Configuration**: Define Client Route and Upstream Target
3. **Add Policies**: Security, validation, transformation policies
4. **Test**: Testing with Test Console
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to environment(s)

## API Proxy Components

### Client Route

The endpoint that receives requests from clients. It is the gateway of the API Proxy to the outside world.

### Upstream Target

The address of the backend API. It is the target where the API Proxy routes requests.

### Policies

Policies applied to the API Proxy:
* Security policies (OAuth2, JWT, mTLS)
* Traffic management policies (Rate Limiting, Quota)
* Transformation policies (JSON Transform, XML Transform)
* Validation policies (JSON Schema, XML Schema)
