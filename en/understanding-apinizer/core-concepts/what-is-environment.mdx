---

An Environment is a virtual server space in the Apinizer Platform where API Proxies are deployed and made accessible. Each environment has its own access address and settings, operates in isolation from other environments, and uses dedicated resources such as CPU and RAM.

## The Environment Concept

An Environment corresponds to a **Namespace** in the Kubernetes context. Kubernetes clusters can manage large amounts of disconnected workloads simultaneously. Kubernetes uses a concept called Namespace to reduce the complexity of objects within the cluster.

<Info>
  **Namespaces** allow objects to be grouped together and these groups to be filtered and controlled as a single unit. This enables the application of customized access control policies or grouping to separate all units from each other for purposes such as a test environment.

## Environment Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Isolation" icon="lock">
    Each environment is completely isolated from other environments. API Proxies in one environment cannot directly communicate with API Proxies in other environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Allocation" icon="server">
    Each environment has dedicated resources such as CPU and RAM. These resources are not shared with other environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Address" icon="globe">
    Each environment has its own access address (URL). API Proxies in the environment can be accessed through this address.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings" icon="gear">
    Each environment has its own specific settings. These settings are independent from other environments.

## Why Use Multiple Environments?

It is recommended to use multiple environments for two main reasons:

### 1. Lifecycle Management

Managing the API lifecycle by creating environments for different purposes such as Development, Test, and Production.

  <Card title="Development" icon="code">
    Development environment. The environment where new features are developed and tested.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test" icon="flask">
    Test environment. The environment where comprehensive tests of developed features are performed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production" icon="rocket">
    Production environment. The environment where the live system runs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Resource Isolation

Ensuring that APIs that consume many resources work in isolation by grouping them, thus preventing the performance of other APIs from being adversely affected.

<Info>
  For example, high-traffic APIs can run in one environment, while low-traffic APIs can run in another environment. This optimizes resource usage.
</Info>

## Environment Components

An environment contains the following components:

* **Worker Pods**: Pods where API Proxies run
* **Cache Pods**: Distributed cache pods
* **Integration Pods**: Pods where API Integrator tasks run

## Environment Management

### Creating an Environment

When creating a new environment, the following information is defined:

* **Environment Name**: Unique name identifying the environment
* **Access Address**: URL to be used for accessing the environment
* **Resource Limits**: CPU and RAM limits
* **Settings**: Environment-specific configurations

### Deploying API Proxies

API Proxies can be deployed on one or more environments. The same API Proxy can run with different versions in different environments.

<Warning>
  **Important**: All environments where deployment is performed are located within a cluster and run on the servers where the Apinizer Platform is installed.
</Warning>

## Environment and Kubernetes Namespace Relationship

All environments created with the Apinizer Platform run on Kubernetes infrastructure. Each environment corresponds to a Namespace in Kubernetes:

```
Apinizer Environment → Kubernetes Namespace
├─ Development → apinizer-dev
├─ Test → apinizer-test
└─ Production → apinizer-prod
```

This structure enables:
* Isolation between environments
* Control of resource usage
* Access control
* Manageable scaling
