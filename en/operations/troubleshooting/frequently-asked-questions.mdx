## Display in Portal Interface

Every question you save in Manager automatically reflects on the FAQ page on the portal side. When the portal page is opened, the system loads all active questions registered at that moment and displays them in accordion form by categorizing them as in the screen below.

- **Category Tabs:** According to the category you selected in Manager, tabs (`All`, `Eğitim`, `Portal`, etc.) are automatically created in the upper section on the portal.
- **Accordion Structure:** Users clicking on the question see the answer expanded. Content entered with Markdown preserves formats such as bold text, list, link.
- **Language Support:** When you change the portal language between TR/EN, only FAQ records created in that language are listed. If display in a different language is desired, a separate record should be opened for the relevant language in Manager.

### How Does Data Flow Work in Portal Application?

**Manager → Portal Synchronization (User Perspective)**

- **Save in Manager:** The moment you create and save the FAQ record leaving it `Active`, the information is written to the central database.
- **Open Portal Page:** When portal user enters the `FAQ` menu, the screen automatically loads all active questions registered at that moment.
- **Categories Are Automatically Created:** Category names you gave in Manager appear as upper tabs on the portal; users see only questions belonging to that category whichever tab they click.
- **Instant Update:** When you deactivate a question in Manager or change its answer, the new content is immediately reflected when the portal page is refreshed. No extra publishing step is needed.
- **Language Compatibility:** Don't forget to add separate records for each language in multi-language portals. When portal language is changed, questions belonging to that language are shown; other languages are hidden.
