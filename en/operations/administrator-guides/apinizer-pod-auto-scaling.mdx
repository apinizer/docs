title: "Automatic Scaling of Apinizer Environments"
description: "You can configure horizontal auto-scaling operations for pods, optimize resource usage by automatically increasing and decreasing pod count according to application demands, and configure scaling policies and thresholds."
---

This document explains how to configure horizontal auto-scaling **(horizontal auto-scaling)** operations for pods.

This horizontal scaling feature optimizes resource usage by automatically increasing and decreasing pod count according to application demands.

To use the scaling feature in your Kubernetes cluster, a metric-server must be installed. If it is not present, you can [click here](/tr/setup/kubernetes/kubernetes-metric-server.mdx) for installation.

## Configuration

Create yaml file:

```bash
sudo vi hpa-autoscaling.yaml
```

<Tip>
Edit `NAMESPACE` and `DEPLOYMENT_NAME` fields in yaml according to your application.
</Tip>

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: apinizer-hpa
  namespace: <NAMESPACE>
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      selectPolicy: Max
      policies:
        - type: Pods
          value: 1
          periodSeconds: 60
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
      policies:
        - type: Pods
          value: 1
          periodSeconds: 60
      selectPolicy: Max
```

Apply yaml file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manager-hpa-autoscaling.yaml
```

## Configuration Parameters

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| `scaleTargetRef` | This field specifies which deployment scaling will work for. Example: manager. |
| `minReplicas` | Minimum number of pods that should exist. Example: 2. |
| `maxReplicas` | Maximum number of pods that can exist in the system. Example: 10. |
| `averageUtilization` | In this field, you can enter a percentage value for cpu and memory usage. It will create pods when it exceeds the specified level. |
| `scaleDown` | When it falls below the target usage level, it will reduce pods by the given value amount every 60 seconds from the pods it newly created. |
| `scaleUp` | When it exceeds the target usage level, it is checked for 60 seconds, which is the **stabilizationWindowSeconds** value specified. If the condition is met, one pod is added to your cluster every 60 seconds. |

<Tip>
To disable scaleDown feature, change it to **"selectPolicy: Disabled"**.
