## Causes of Performance Issues

<Warning>
Performance degradation can usually be caused by the following factors:
</Warning>

- High traffic volume
- Insufficient resource allocation (CPU, RAM)
- Database query performance
- Network delays
- Policy execution times
- Cache configuration issues

## Performance Monitoring

<Info>
To monitor performance metrics in Apinizer:
</Info>

1. **Analytics Dashboard:** You can get detailed information about API traffic and response times.
2. **Prometheus Metrics:** You can monitor system resource usage and performance metrics.
3. **Log Analysis:** You can detect slow responding requests from log files.

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation

- Allocate sufficient CPU and RAM resources to pods
- Configure auto-scaling settings
- Optimize JVM parameters

### Database Optimization

- Optimize database queries
- Configure connection pooling settings
- Check indexes

### Cache Strategy

- Use appropriate cache policies
- Optimize cache TTL values
- Set cache sizes

### Policy Optimization

- Remove unnecessary policies
- Optimize policy execution order
- Optimize script policies

## DNS Resolution Performance

<Warning>
In systems with intensive environment usage or high number of rate limit definitions, the situation where some service addresses cannot be resolved instantly may be caused by insufficient DNS resolution performance.
</Warning>

### Solution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Increase CoreDNS Resource Limits">
    CPU and RAM resources should be increased to enable processing more queries simultaneously.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute CoreDNS Over Nodes">
    Deployment should be reconfigured so that there is one CoreDNS pod on each worker node. This way, DNS queries can be processed in a distributed manner without piling up at a central point.
  </Step>
</Steps>
