## Problem Symptoms

<Warning>
High latency and slow response times usually manifest themselves with the following symptoms:
</Warning>

- API response times increasing (e.g., more than 5 seconds)
- User complaints
- Timeout errors increasing
- High p95/p99 latency values
- Backend services responding slowly

## Problem Causes

High latency and slow response times can usually be caused by the following factors:

- **Backend Service Delays**: Backend APIs responding slowly
- **Database Query Performance**: Slow database queries
- **Network Delays**: High network latency
- **Policy Execution Times**: Complex policies taking long
- **Resource Insufficiency**: CPU or RAM insufficiency
- **Cache Misses**: Data not being retrieved from cache
- **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Connection pool being exhausted

## Detection Methods

### 1. Analytics Dashboard

Monitor response times in Analytics dashboard:

- Average response time
- P50, P95, P99 latency values
- Endpoint-based response times
- Error rates

### 2. Log Analysis

Search for slow requests in log files:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> | grep -i "slow"
kubectl logs <pod-name> | grep -i "timeout"
kubectl logs <pod-name> | grep -i "latency"
```

### 3. Tracing

Monitor request flow using distributed tracing:

- Detect at which step the request slowed down
- Measure backend service delays
- Analyze policy execution times

## Solution Recommendations

### 1. Backend Service Optimization

Optimize backend services performance:

- Measure backend service response times
- Detect slow endpoints
- Optimize backend services
- Increase backend service resources if necessary

### 2. Database Query Optimization

Optimize database queries:

- Detect slow queries
- Check indexes
- Analyze query plans
- Avoid unnecessary joins
- Use connection pooling

### 3. Cache Strategy

Optimize cache strategy:

- Cache frequently used data
- Optimize cache TTL values
- Increase cache hit rate
- Use distributed cache

### 4. Policy Optimization

Optimize policy execution times:

- Remove unnecessary policies
- Optimize policy order
- Optimize script policies
- Use conditional policies

### 5. Network Optimization

Reduce network delays:

- Position pods close to backend services
- Optimize traffic using service mesh
- Use CDN (in appropriate cases)
- Optimize network policies

### 6. Resource Allocation

Optimize pod resources:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "4Gi"
  requests:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2Gi"
```

- Allocate sufficient CPU and RAM resources
- Configure auto-scaling settings
- Optimize JVM parameters

### 7. Connection Pooling

Optimize connection pool settings:

- Increase connection pool size
- Set connection timeout values
- Manage idle connections

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Metrics

Regularly monitor the following metrics:

- **Response Time**: Average, P50, P95, P99
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Error rate
- **Backend Latency**: Backend service response times

### 2. Alerting

Set up alerts for performance issues:

- High latency alerts
- High error rate alerts
- Backend timeout alerts

## Preventive Measures

### 1. Load Testing

- Perform regular load tests
- Detect performance issues early
- Perform capacity planning

### 2. Code Review

- Review code that may cause performance issues
- Follow best practices
- Perform profiling

### 3. Monitoring

- Set up comprehensive monitoring
- Perform trend analysis
- Perform proactive optimization
