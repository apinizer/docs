title: "Alerting on Log Patterns"
description: "You can create alerts based on log patterns using Kibana, define specific log patterns, determine alert conditions, and configure alert actions. You can create alerts based on error log patterns, performance metrics, and user behavior patterns."

## Overview

Kibana is an interface program used to visualize and analyze Elasticsearch data. Alerts can be created based on log patterns using Kibana.

<Info>
Kibana alerting feature can automatically send notifications when specific log patterns are detected and inform system administrators about critical situations.

## Creating Alerts

The following steps can be followed to create alerts based on log patterns in Kibana:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Defining Log Patterns">
    Specific log patterns need to be defined. These patterns can include critical events such as error messages, performance metrics, or user behaviors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determining Alert Conditions">
    Alert conditions need to be determined. For example, conditions such as how many times the pattern should be seen within a specific time interval can be defined.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring Alert Actions">
    Alert actions need to be configured. Notification channels such as email, Slack, webhook can be configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setting Up Alert Channels">
    Alert channels need to be set up. Channels and recipients where notifications will be sent can be determined.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    Alerts can be created based on error log patterns. Alerts can be defined for system errors, API errors, or critical error messages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Alerts can be created based on performance metrics. Alerts can be defined for metrics such as slow response times, high CPU usage, or memory consumption.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Behavior Patterns" icon="users">
    Alerts can be created based on user behavior patterns. Alerts can be defined for abnormal user activities, security violations, or suspicious behaviors.
