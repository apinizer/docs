API traffic logs are recorded in Elasticsearch, system logs are stored as Kubernetes pod logs, and application logs are found in Apinizer component log files. Knowing log locations is critical for troubleshooting and system monitoring."

## Overview

Log files can be stored in different locations in the Apinizer system. Knowing log locations is critical for troubleshooting and system monitoring.

<Warning>
Knowing log file locations saves time in troubleshooting processes and provides access to correct log sources.
</Warning>

## Log Locations

Logs are stored in the following locations in the Apinizer system:

  <Card title="API Traffic Logs" icon="network-wired">
    API traffic logs are recorded in Elasticsearch. These logs contain detailed information about API requests and responses and can be visualized using Kibana.
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Logs" icon="server">
    System logs are stored in Kubernetes as pod logs. These logs contain system-level activities of Apinizer components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Application Logs" icon="file-alt">
    Application logs are found in Apinizer component log files. These logs contain application-level activities and errors.

## Log Access Methods

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accessing Elasticsearch Logs">
    You can access API traffic logs through the Kibana interface. Kibana is used to visualize and analyze logs in Elasticsearch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accessing Kubernetes Pod Logs">
    You can access system logs using Kubernetes kubectl commands. For example, you can view pod logs with the `kubectl logs <pod-name>` command.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accessing Application Log Files">
    You can access application log files from log directories inside pods. Log files are usually found in `/var/log/apinizer` or similar directories.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Kibana Integration

Logs recorded in Elasticsearch can be visualized and analyzed using Kibana.

<Info>
Kibana allows you to view and analyze logs in Elasticsearch in real-time. You can examine log data using Discover, Visualize, and Dashboard tabs.
