title: "Log Pattern Analysis"
description: "You can perform pattern analysis of API traffic logs using Kibana. You can perform time-based log analysis, detect error patterns, analyze performance metrics, and examine user behavior patterns. Kibana is an interface program used to visualize and analyze Elasticsearch data."

## Overview

Log pattern analysis involves analyzing and visualizing API traffic logs using Kibana.

<Info>
Kibana is an interface program used to visualize and analyze Elasticsearch data. Kibana communicates with the Elasticsearch cluster to retrieve data. When the Kibana server is lost, all data is safely stored in the Elasticsearch cluster.
</Info>

One of Kibana's core features is the ability to monitor logs recorded in Elasticsearch in real-time. This allows you to track and analyze log data in real-time.

## Pattern Analysis Types

Various visualizations can be created in Kibana for log pattern analysis:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Time-Based Log Analysis" icon="clock">
    You can examine the distribution and trends of logs over time with time-based log analysis. This analysis shows how system activities change over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error Pattern Detection" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    You can identify recurring errors and error sources with error pattern detection. This speeds up troubleshooting processes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance Metrics Analysis" icon="chart-line">
    You can examine API response times, transaction volumes, and resource usage with performance metrics analysis. This analysis is critical for performance optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Behavior Pattern Analysis" icon="users">
    You can examine user activities, access patterns, and usage trends with user behavior pattern analysis. This is important for improving user experience.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Pattern Analysis Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Collection">
    View log data in Elasticsearch in Kibana. You can access raw log data using the Discover tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pattern Definition">
    Define the patterns you want to analyze. For example, you can identify patterns such as specific error messages, slow response times, or abnormal user activities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creating Visualizations">
    Create visualizations in Kibana. You can visualize patterns using visualizations such as timeline charts, histogram charts, or pie charts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analysis and Interpretation">
    Analyze the created visualizations and interpret patterns. Identify trends, anomalies, and improvement areas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reporting">
    Report and share analysis results. You can visualize and share analysis results by creating dashboards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases
