## Overview

Kibana is an interface program used to visualize and analyze Elasticsearch data. Kibana communicates with the Elasticsearch cluster to retrieve data.

<Info>
One of Kibana's core features is the ability to monitor logs recorded in Elasticsearch in real-time. This allows you to track and analyze log data in real-time.
