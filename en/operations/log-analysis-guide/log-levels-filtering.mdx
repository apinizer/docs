title: "Log Levels and Filtering"
description: "You can filter by log levels in Apinizer and focus on specific log types. You can filter logs at ERROR, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG levels, filter by time range, API Proxy, and status code. You can analyze API traffic logs using Kibana."

## Overview

Log levels and filtering are critical for analyzing API traffic logs using Kibana.

<Info>
Kibana is an interface program used to visualize and analyze Elasticsearch data. Filtering can be done by log levels using Kibana and focus can be placed on specific log types.
</Info>

## Log Levels

Log levels used in Apinizer are as follows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="ERROR" icon="exclamation-circle" color="#dc3545">
    Error logs contain critical issues and system errors. Logs at this level indicate situations requiring urgent intervention.
  </Card>
  <Card title="WARN" icon="exclamation-triangle" color="#ffc107">
    Warning logs contain potential issues and situations that need attention. Logs at this level are important for preventive maintenance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="INFO" icon="info-circle" color="#17a2b8">
    Information logs contain general system activities and informative messages. Logs at this level are used to track system status.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DEBUG" icon="bug" color="#6c757d">
    Debug logs contain detailed technical information. Logs at this level are used in troubleshooting and development processes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Filtering Options

Various filtering options can be used in Kibana:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Filtering by Time Range" icon="clock">
    You can view logs in a specific time range. You can select predefined ranges such as last 15 minutes, last 1 hour, last 24 hours, or custom time ranges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filtering by Log Level" icon="layer-group">
    You can filter logs at specific log levels. For example, you can view only logs at ERROR level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filtering by API Proxy" icon="network-wired">
    You can filter logs belonging to a specific API Proxy. This is useful for analyzing the performance and errors of a specific API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filtering by Status Code" icon="hashtag">
    You can filter by HTTP status codes. For example, you can view only requests with 500 error codes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Filtering Use Cases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Error Analysis">
    You can analyze system errors by filtering logs at ERROR level. You can detect specific errors with time range and API Proxy-based filtering.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Performance Monitoring">
    You can monitor performance metrics by filtering logs at INFO and WARN levels for a specific API Proxy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Troubleshooting">
    You can access detailed technical information and perform troubleshooting operations by filtering logs at DEBUG level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Security Analysis">
    You can detect security violations and unauthorized access attempts by filtering by status code.
  </Step>
</Steps>
