## Database Collection Names

The following table shows the MongoDB collections used in Apinizer and the data they contain:

| Page Name | Collection Name in Database | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Application Logs](/en/develop/monitoring-analysis/application-logs) | `apinizer_log` | Records for software logs generated during the execution of the flow for incoming and outgoing messages to API Proxy |
| [Audit Records](/en/admin/audit-compliance/audit-records) | `audit_event` | Collection where changes made by users on the system are recorded. Operations performed are recorded with parameters such as date, operation type, user, object ID, object name, and audit object type |
| [ACL Audit Records](/en/admin/audit-compliance/audit-records) | `history_acl` | Collection where user information (credential) records are kept for granting or revoking access permissions to API Proxy or API Proxy Group. Information such as operation date, operation type, reason, which user it applies to, which API Proxy/API Proxy Group and method it applies to is kept in this collection |
| [Alert](/en/monitor/alarm) | `alert_history` | Information such as operation time, message information in the action, and which object triggered it for alerts created using actions under certain conditions on Apinizer |
| [Token Requests](/en/develop/policies/token-service/overview) | `log_tokentraffic` | Records for relevant parts of incoming and outgoing messages for token requests |
| [Anomaly Detector](/en/monitor/anomaly-detector) | `anomaly_detector_result` | Records kept to find anomalies in API traffic |
| [Uptime Monitor](/en/monitor/api-health-check) | `uptime_monitor_result` | Log records for Uptime Monitoring operation results |
| [Task Flow](/en/integrations/api-integrator-task-flow-builder/taskflow-monitor) | `taskflow_execution_log` | Records for logs generated during the execution of actions in Integration Task Flow steps |
| [Report Generator](/en/analytic/analytics-reports/report-generator) | `report_configuration_result` | Records for software logs generated during report definition execution |
| [Trace](/en/develop/monitoring-analysis/step-by-step-tracing) | `log_apiproxytraffic` | Collection that records information about API traffic when Trace is enabled in API Proxy traffic. Contains basic traffic information about an API's usage and details about which proxy it was processed through |
| [Trace](/en/develop/monitoring-analysis/step-by-step-tracing) | `log_apiproxytraffic_policy_execution` | Structure containing information about policy application processes when Trace is enabled in API Proxy traffic. Represents information about the state before and after policy(ies) are applied |
| [Trace](/en/develop/monitoring-analysis/step-by-step-tracing) | `log_apiproxytraffic_routing` | Structure representing events such as routing, retry, and failover when Trace is enabled in API Proxy traffic. Keeps information about which routes an API request passed through, how retry or failover processes worked in case of any error |
| - | `user_token_blackList` | Collection where each login operation is kept as a separate record when users log in multiple times |
| [Notifications](/en/integrations/connectors/notification-connector) | `notification_user` | Collection where user notifications are kept |
|

<Warning>
  Some collections contain critical data. Especially cleaning `audit_event` and `history_acl` collections is not recommended. Before interfering with these collections, backup should be taken and careful evaluation should be made.
</Warning>
