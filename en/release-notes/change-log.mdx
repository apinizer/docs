**ATTENTION**: With the version upgrade of the JDK used by Apinizer, the usage method of the JVM parameter "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage" has changed. This value, which previously allowed Integer type data usage (-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75), now expects values as Double (-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0), so old values in the yaml file need to be updated to be decimal. If the update is expected to be done by Apinizer manager, pods will need to be restarted after Apinizer manager is opened. Otherwise, this field needs to be fixed as a decimal number by manually making changes in deployments.

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#065f46', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>
