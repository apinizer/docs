## Version 2021.11.1

**Release Date: November 1, 2021**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### Apinizer API Developer Portal

The first version of Apinizer API Developer Portal was released! API Portal is an important communication channel for APIs, serving as a bridge between API Provider and API Consumer. API Provider defines the API Proxies it wants to expose to the outside world from the Apinizer Manager Console. API Consumer also manages how to communicate with an API through the Apinizer API Developer Portal. The goal is to enable API Provider to easily share API Proxies and enable their consumption. Additionally, Apinizer provides design customization on API Developer Portal, access to and testing of API Catalog and API Documentation, Terms & Conditions definition, API analytics, API traffic monitoring, account management, credential management, and access control capabilities based on API and Credential.

- ### Portal API

API can be created from API Proxy through the management section by the API Developer Portal Administrator. Thus, external sources can access through the environment assigned to the API Proxy. Additionally, Portal Administrator manages API accessibility from here.

- ### Portal Accounts

Accounts that can log into the API Developer Portal, whether they are organization managers or not, are defined by the API Developer Portal Administrator. An account that is an organization manager has the authority to create other accounts belonging to its sub-organizations. The account can manage APIs assigned to it or assign them to another account. Each account determines its own credentials for sending requests to the API. Additionally, access control based on credential for API or credential access restriction based on API can be made.

- ### Portal Settings

Customization, email management, terms & conditions, and integration operations that are valid throughout the portal are configured by the API Developer Portal Administrator.

**APNZ-2593** : Credential relationship appears even though it was removed from contract.

**APNZ-2599** : Audit record is not kept for every object.

**APNZ-2601** : Credential in expired contract can make requests and does not give "Contract Expire Date ..vs" error.

**APNZ-2605** : WS-Security policy gives error.

**APNZ-2606** : Delete and filter operations on Application Logs screen do not work consistently.

**APNZ-2607** : Audit pages/tabs do not open.

**APNZ-2609** : Project filter in Credential's ACL tab does not work. Same API Proxy can be added to credential multiple times.

**APNZ-2619** : When logging in, even though project is selected, it behaves as if it is not.

**APNZ-2624** : Error occurs when a parameter is used in multiple places in DB-2-API.

## Version 2021.06.1

**Release Date: June 1, 2021**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### API Proxy Template

With API Proxy Template that can be defined for each project, all API Proxies in that Project are created according to the specified template. Thus, definitions common to all or most API Proxies such as Cache, CORS, Authentication, Error Response Template, Forwarded IP Header Parameter, API Based Quota, and API Based Throttling can be made once, reducing the work of API Developers. Features coming with API Proxy Template can be changed for API Proxy if desired.

- ### Mock API Creator

With Mock API Creator, Mock APIs that return predefined responses for requests can be created easily and quickly. These responses can be customized according to conditions. RESTful Mock APIs created in this way can be used for purposes such as prototyping or testing.

## Version 2021.05.1

**Release Date: May 1, 2021**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### Project Full Export

All entities defined in a Project can be exported (export) for backup purposes or to create a new project with the same settings by importing (import).

- ### API Proxy Groups

API Proxy Groups enable managing and deploying multiple API Proxies as a group to configure Policies and control access. Access can be provided through the API Proxy Group's URL by disabling the own URLs of API Proxies in the API Proxy Group.

- ### Identity Management

Enables managing identities of clients (API Consumers) who can access API Proxies from a single point and easily creating Access Control Lists (ACLs).

- ### DB-2-API Cursor support

Cursor support was added for methods/endpoints using Stored Procedure in DB-2-API module.

- ### Contract/Protocol

Enables managing topics such as to whom, when, according to which contract/protocol API Proxies are opened, when the contract/protocol will end, and automatic closure of access to API Proxies accordingly.

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#bfdbfe', color: '#1e40af', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>IMPORTANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS</span>

## Version 2021.03.1

**Release Date: March 1, 2021**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### API Proxy Cloning

Capability to clone an API Proxy and thus create a new API Proxy with another name with the same settings was added. API Proxy clone is a very useful method especially for a new version of an API Proxy that is desired to be opened from a different address.

- ### Single and Distributed options in Load Balancing

Single and Distributed options for Load Balancing were added in API Proxy Routing section.

**Single**: Each Worker server keeps Routing information on itself for load balancing. Thus, a significant performance increase is achieved in Routing operations. However, it does not guarantee 100% compliance with the selected algorithm (Round Robin, LRU, Weighted, etc.) when distributing load among Worker servers.

**Distributed**: Distributed cache is used during load balancing to decide which Worker server the request will be sent to. Thus, it guarantees 100% compliance with the selected algorithm (Round Robin, LRU, Weighted, etc.) when distributing load among Worker servers. However, its performance is worse than the Single option.

- ### APICrypt

APICrypt enables encrypted communication by passing request/response messages through an HSM device.

- ### Syslog Integration

Log records can also be written to Syslog and integrated with central log systems.

- ### Empty API

Empty API enables creating API Proxy for APIs/Web Services without API definition files. This way, code-first developed APIs can also be easily opened through Apinizer.

- ### Test Tools

Test tools can be used to send requests to API/Web Services and see if they return a response or see the content of the returned response. This way, it is possible to quickly perform tests without leaving the Apinizer environment.

- ### Test History

History is kept for all tests performed. It is possible to run the same tests using records in history.

- ### Test Collection

As test usage increases, using history may become difficult. It is possible to prepare Test Collections, group test definitions, and save them, thus making them more manageable.

- ### Test with Log Record

If there are requests that received errors, they can be immediately repeated from within the interface showing log records. This way, without performing any search operation, the request that caused the error can be repeated directly, and testing can be done quickly and easily again.

- ### Expired Token Cleaner

A task was created that automatically deletes expired tokens stored in the database. Apinizer administrator can stop this task from Management → Scheduled Jobs menu if desired, or make it run again at any time.

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#bfdbfe', color: '#1e40af', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>IMPORTANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS</span>

- Endpoint to be opened for relevant Task Flow in Task Flow screen comes passive by default, user can activate it if desired.

- If SOAPAction header is not present in Soap1.1 service, SOAPAction described in WSDL is automatically added.

- Error Message screen in Admin menu was fixed for easy definitions.

- JDBC URL Template coming by default for database connectors was ensured.

- Test Console and Test Tools were added to the top menu so they can be easily accessed from anywhere within the application.

- When changes occur in global policies, capability to show all API Proxies using it on the same screen and redeploy was provided.
