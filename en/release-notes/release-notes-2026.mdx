## Version 2026.01.0

**Release Date: January 14, 2026**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>FEATURED NEW FEATURES</span>

- ### API Manager Application Authorization System 
The authorization system in the Apinizer API Manager application has been renewed. Authorization now works based on the **asset category + action** model. Components with similar functions have been grouped under asset categories (API Management, Connections, Identity and Access Control, etc.) and specific actions (View, Manage, Deploy/Undeploy, Execute, Export/Import) have been defined for each category. This provides a more flexible, detailed, and secure authorization management. [See.](/en/admin/user-access-management/authorization-matrix) 

- ### Cache Server Definition in Namespace Independent from Gateway
The requirement for worker pods that serve as the gateway function in the Apinizer application infrastructure and Hazelcast pods used for cache operations to be in the same namespace has been removed. Worker pods and cache pods can now be managed in separate namespaces. This provides a more flexible infrastructure configuration.

- ### Multi-API Portal Support
Support for managing multiple independent API Portals from a single Apinizer installation has been added. This enables offering customized portal experiences for different business units or customer groups.

- ### Advanced Routing Features
API Gateway routing capabilities have been enriched with **Sticky Session (Session Affinity)**, **Exponential Retry Delay**, and **Active Health Check** mechanisms. This makes traffic management more flexible, resilient, and intelligent. [See.](/en/develop/routing/http-routing)

- ### APIOps Management API Improvements
In line with the vision that all administrative functions of Apinizer can be performed through APIOps Management APIs; full API support has been added for Credential Secrets management, Keys/Keystores operations, and JWK configurations. Additionally, the ability to create and update JWK from certificate, public key, private key, and keystore has been added. [See.](/api-reference/credentials/secrets)

- ### Upstream Sticky Session (Session Affinity)
Sticky Session support has been added to ensure that clients are always routed to the same backend address. Session state management required for backend structures can now work efficiently through the Gateway with Cookie-based, IP Hash, and Hybrid methods. [See.](/en/develop/routing/sticky-session)

- ### Upstream Active Health Check Mechanism
Active Health Check mechanism has been added that periodically checks the health status of backend services. Backend addresses that are not working correctly are automatically removed from traffic and reintroduced when they recover. [See.](/en/develop/routing/retry-and-failover#active-health-check)

- ### Upstream Exponential Retry Delay
"Exponential Backoff" feature has been added that places increasing delays between retry operations performed in error situations. This provides the necessary time for backend services to recover under heavy load. [See.](/en/develop/routing/retry-and-failover#retry-mekanizmasi)

- ### Environment Diagnostic Screen
Diagnostic screen has been added to monitor the operational status, resource consumption, and health metrics of API Gateway environments. (APNZ-5665, APNZ-5649)

- **When certificate, public key, private key, or keystore is updated via APIOps Management API, if there is a related JWK, the ability to update these JWKs or delete the relationship has been added.**
- **Feature has been added to globally enable/disable the display of log details on the API Traffic screen from General Settings.**
- **Audit logs are now kept for operations involving API Proxy Traffic Log settings.**
- **Search options with ends_with and wildcard have been added to FTP Read and List operations.**
- **Client Route Report has been enhanced to find conflicting path values of API Proxies with similar relative path values.**
- **API Portal Overview page has been enhanced.**

- **Elasticsearch Version Update:** ES client version has been upgraded from 7.9.2 to 7.17.29; ES7 and ES8 versions are now fully supported.
- **Global Deploy Improvement:** When global policies are updated, an option has been added to deploy only API Proxies that are already published in the relevant environment or all API Proxies. This prevents API Proxies that are not deployed from being accidentally deployed. (APNZ-5652)
- **Asynchronous Operation Resource Management:** Thread usage of tasks running asynchronously in Script and API Call policies has been limited, increasing system stability.
- **Detailed confirmation and warning that restart is required for changes to be applied have been added to the API Root Context change section in General Settings.**
- **Load balancing is now always done locally (per pod). Distributed cache usage has been removed for performance.**
- **Indication of disabled methods in API Proxy Group has been enabled.**
- **Styling work has been done on large text areas in areas such as test console and data operations.**
- **Detailed confirmation has been added for save&republish operation after entering host alias.**
- **Visual design improvements have been made on the probe screen of the Kubernetes Resources page.**
- **Monthly-daily reporting feature has been added to API Portal Usage Statistics.**
- **Ability to download account information in Excel format from API Portal Accounts/Developers page has been enabled.**
- **In export/import operations via APIOps Management API, "-imported" word is no longer added to DB2API definitions.**
- **Customizable Landing Page feature has been added for API Portal.**
- **In XML Schema Validation policy errors, related element and path information has been added to the error message.**
- **Audit logs kept for operations performed with APIOps Management APIs have been detailed.**
