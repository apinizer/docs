- ### Manual Kubernetes Management

By default, definition and management of Gateway and Cache servers on Kubernetes was being done through Apinizer. With this version, the ability to manually manage existing Kubernetes clusters has been enabled by only making relevant metadata definitions. Thus, the requirement for Kubernetes environments to be managed through Apinizer management console has been made optional.

- ### Personal API Access Token Creation

Personal API Access Token is token information used to authenticate the user's identity instead of password in the process of accessing Apinizer Management API. It is produced specifically for the user by the user logging into the management console.

- ### Restoring API Proxy According to Deployment History

API Proxy can be restored to its previous revision (deployed state) through API Proxy deployment history.

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#bfdbfe', color: '#1e40af', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>IMPORTANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS</span>

## Version 2023.05.1

**Release Date: May 18, 2023**

<Warning>
    Since the encryption method of sensitive data stored in the database has been upgraded in this version, it is strongly recommended to back up the database before performing the update.
</Warning>

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### Defining SNMP Connection Configuration

SNMP connection definitions can be made to enable sending data to monitoring tools supporting SNMP protocol through Apinizer.

- ### Creating Action with SNMP

Sending data in actions created using SNMP Connection definitions to monitoring systems is enabled.

- ### Completely Disabling Elasticsearch Logging

Apinizer manages the logging process with Elasticsearch by default and performs all its queries on Elasticsearch for analytical operations on the Manager console. If desired, this feature can be disabled. When disabled, it should be noted that the analytics module, some policies, and monitoring features will be unavailable.

- ### Transferring Logs to Another System with Kafka Integration

By default, elements of messages coming to and going from API Proxy are stored on Elasticsearch. By making Kafka Integration, transfer of messages to a different application through the queue system can be performed.

- ### mTLS Authentication Policy

mTLS Authentication (Mutual Transport Layer Security Authentication) Policy is one of the authentication methods performed on the Apinizer side. This method is a type of TLS protocol used to create a secure channel between client and server. When mTLS Authentication is used, Apinizer checks the validity of the client's certificate in incoming requests and ensures that a trusted certificate authority (CA) is used to ensure it comes from a specific certificate authority.

- ### Applying mTLS Setting to Request

mTLS configuration can be activated through Routing settings. Thus, the Apinizer client that will send from Apinizer to the target service verifies the target service's certificate and indicates that it also has a certificate and needs to be verified by the target service. The target service also verifies the client's certificate, and thus secure communication is established with the client.

- ### Applying mTLS Setting to Credential

If it is desired for the certificate to be verified with mTLS Authentication Policy of Credential, certificate upload for Credential can be performed.

- ### Log Settings Based on API Proxy Group

Settings can be made for whether message information coming to and going from API Proxies added to API Proxy Group will be logged in Elasticsearch database according to message elements (header, parameter, body) or transfer logs to a defined system (Syslog, Webhook, RabbitMQ, Kafka).

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#bfdbfe', color: '#1e40af', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>IMPORTANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS</span>

## Version 2023.03.1

**Release Date: March 14, 2023**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### JSON Web Keypair Set (JWK) Creation

JWK holds public key or keypair information in JSON format. Keys, key sets, keypairs, or keypair sets can be created in 4 different types (RSA, EC, OCT, OKP) with 4 different methods (convert from key store, get from URL connection, paste from clipboard, generate). While these key definitions are used for validation or signing operations on message content in requests with JOSE policies, they are used for decryption or encryption of content in the response line.

- ### JOSE Validation Policy

JOSE (Javascript Object Signing and Encryption) is a solution used to facilitate secure transfer of "claim" or generally JSON data between any two parties. With JOSE Validation Policy, signature validation of signed data and decryption of encrypted data are performed.

- ### JOSE Implementation Policy

JOSE (Javascript Object Signing and Encryption) is a solution used to facilitate secure transfer of "claim" or generally JSON data between any two parties. With JOSE Implementation Policy, signing and encryption operations of data are performed.

- ### Elasticsearch Configuration

If logging is desired to be written to Elasticsearch by an external system rather than directly through Apinizer, Elasticsearch can be switched to read-only mode. In this case, writing of message logs coming to and going from API Proxy to Elasticsearch cluster is stopped on Apinizer and only reading logs is actively performed. Thus, query operations run by analytics screens continue.

- ### Transferring Logs with Webhook Integration

By default, elements of messages coming to and going from API Proxy are stored on Elasticsearch. By making Webhook Integration, logging of messages can be transferred to a different application.

- ### Transferring Logs to Another System with RabbitMQ Integration

By default, elements of messages coming to and going from API Proxy are stored on Elasticsearch. By making RabbitMQ Integration, transfer of messages to a different application through the queue system can be performed.

- ### Creating Alarm for System Information

In real-time systems, catching situations related to system resource usage before they turn into problems is an important requirement to prevent application performance from decreasing. Thus, solutions are produced for possible problems, preventing their occurrence. Alarm enables monitoring of Kubernetes modules and Elasticsearch clusters where the Apinizer Platform is located according to predefined trigger types. If the given threshold value is exceeded, a notification is created on the application.

- ### Creating a New Action Type: Notification

When creating Anomaly Detector, Uptime Monitor, API Integrator, or Alarm, a new action called notification creation action can be added to process the result at the end of the timer. Thus, whenever each job definition runs, notifications are sent to all users or users who want to receive notifications. Users can manage their notifications from the application's interface.

- ### Managing Notifications

Notifications are created on Apinizer as a result of 3 different situations; notifications showing action results, Account/Developer creation requests, and API Product subscription requests. All notifications can be viewed from the icon in the application's header section, and notification management can be done by clicking on the relevant notification category.

- ### Creating Connection Definition from MongoDB

MongoDB has been added as a new type to database connection configurations.

- ### Creating DB-2-API Find Method with MongoDB

When creating endpoints from database with Db-2-API in the API Creator module, endpoints can be added by writing find query with MongoDB configuration.

- ### Controlling All API Proxy Log Settings Based on Project or Application

Previously, settings were made on 3 different bases as Project, API Proxy Group, and API Proxy for which message elements' log records would be taken in which region. To improve the usability and manageability of log settings, it has been reduced to only API Proxy basis. There are 3 different screens to enable or disable log settings; they can be set from each API Proxy's own page, or multiple API Proxy log settings can be made through the Log Settings screen found based on Project and application.

- ### Defining Pod Probes from Kubernetes Resources Screen

Kubernetes uses Probes to know when containers will be restarted, ready, and started. Basically, Probes check the health of containers and ensure that unresponsive applications are restarted. Definition of Pods' Probes has been enabled through Apinizer.
