## Version 2024.09.0

**Release Date: September 9, 2024**

This document contains New Features, Changes, Improvements, and Bug Fixes for version 2024.09.0.

<Warning>
    For users updating from version 2024.05.3 Patch, multiple API Proxy selection in API Proxy Group has been enabled. With this setting, the feature of applying policies from API Proxy Group to API Proxies that was previously available has been removed.
</Warning>

<Warning>
    For users updating from version 2024.05.4 Patch, with the security update made, value validation of client IP addresses from browsers in Apinizer Management Console has been made mandatory. Therefore, the requirement for organizations connecting to the interface using "Kubernetes Ingress Controller" to send client IP information via X-Forwarded-For header has been removed.

- ### API Traffic Log Setting

Which fields will be logged or not in message regions belonging to API Proxy and API Proxy Groups was being managed from their own pages. To improve user experience, this setting can now be made application-based and project-based, environment-based from the API Proxy list. Additionally, logging operations can be activated or deactivated with connectors assigned at API Proxy or API Proxy Group level. [See.](/en/analytic/api-traffic-log-settings)

- ### New Connection Configuration: Syslog

Connection definitions can now be made for Syslog to keep log records created through Apinizer in the Syslog system. [See.](/en/integrations/connection-management/syslog)

- ### New Action/Connector: Syslog

Data can now be sent to the relevant system using the connector created using Syslog connection definitions. [See.](/en/integrations/connectors/syslog-connector)

- ### New Connection Configuration: Webhook

Webhook connection definitions can now be made to transfer log records created through Apinizer to the target system via Webhook. [See.](/en/integrations/connection-management/webhook)

- ### Failover Connector Support

When API Proxy Traffic could not be recorded, it was kept in the Apinizer database.
