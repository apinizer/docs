- ### Access Methods for API Proxy or API Proxy Groups Enriched

Clients can now access API Proxy or API Proxy Group addresses with multiple "Relative Path"s or with Hostname without giving any "Relative Path", while they could previously access through a single "Relative Path". [See.](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/client-route)

- ### Environment Variable Feature Added

A value belonging to an entity can now take environment-specific values in different environments. For example, username and password fields in database connection can now be run environment-specifically without entering test and prod environment-specific values and without needing to define separate connections. [See.](/en/develop/environment-variables)

- ### OIDC Policy Added

OIDC operations that could be done with Script Policy in the existing system can now be done directly as Policy. [See.](/en/develop/policies/oidc-authentication)

- ### WS-Security Policies Divided into Sub-Policies

WS-Security timestamp, username-password, encryption, sign, decryption, and sign validation operations that could previously be done with a single policy have each been made into separate policies.

**Timestamp Policy:** Standalone Timestamp addition support has been added to WS-Security policies. Timestamp is added to SOAP messages to control the message's validity period. [See.](/en/develop/policies/ws-security-timestamp)

**WS-Security Username Policy:** Standalone Username addition support has been added to WS-Security policies. Username and password information can now be securely carried in SOAP messages. [See.](/api-reference/policies/policies/policy-ws-security-username)

**WS-Security Encrypt Policy:** Standalone Encrypt capability support has been added to WS-Security policies. Data privacy is increased by enabling encryption of SOAP message content. [See.](/en/develop/policies/ws-security-encryption)

**WS-Security Decrypt Policy:** Standalone Decrypt capability support has been added to WS-Security policies. Decryption of encrypted SOAP messages and secure processing is supported. [See.](/en/develop/policies/ws-decrypt)

**WS-Security Sign Validation Policy:** Standalone Sign Validation capability support has been added to WS-Security policies. Message integrity and authentication are provided by enabling validation of SOAP messages. [See.](/en/develop/policies/ws-security-signature-verification)

- ### WS-Security Policies Usage at Group Level

WS-Security policies can now be defined at Policy Groups level. [See.](/en/develop/global-configurations/policy-groups)

- ### Method-Based "Size" Report in Analytics Module

API request and response sizes can now be analyzed in detail according to HTTP methods with the Method-Based Size Report added to the Analytics module. [See.](/en/analytic/analytics-reports/endpoint-size-metrics)

- ### Request/Response Size Fields Added to Analytics Reports

Request Size and Response Size metrics have been added to report pages in the Analytics module.

- ### FTP Connection Integration Added

FTP Connection support has been added to the system infrastructure. [See.](/en/integrations/connection-management/ftp)

- ### "Read" and "List" Functions Added to FTP Connector

FTP Connector now supports file reading (Read) and listing (List) operations. [See Read](/en/integrations/connectors/ftp-read-connector) [See List](/en/integrations/connectors/ftp-list-connector)

- ### Encoding Support Expanded for Server-Sent Event (SSE) Type Responses

Responses can now be processed even when they come with gzip, zstd, compress, and deflate encoding.

- ### "Environment Variable" Support Added to Upstream Routing Addresses

Addresses added in Upstream Routing can now be selected via "Environment Variable", enabling them to work with their environment value when export/import operations are performed. [See.](/en/develop/routing/http-routing)

- ### New Management API Endpoints Added

A total of 107 Management API Endpoints with 163 different feature configurations have been opened for service. [See.](/api-reference/api-proxies/deployment/deploy-api-proxy.mdx)

- ### Asynchronous Operations Thread Pool Support Added to Environments

Asynchronous operations performed in environments can now be managed by a separate thread pool and configured with parameters. [See.](/en/admin/server-management/gateway-environments)

- ### Kafka Authentication Improvements

SASL/PLAIN and SASL/SCRAM authentication mechanisms have been added to Kafka.

- ### Category-Based API Product Listing in API Portal

API Products on API Portal are now dynamically listed according to categories, and products belonging to the relevant category are automatically displayed on the API Product detail page. Categories are presented in tree structure on the API Product List screen; when a user clicks on a category, only API Products belonging to that category are listed. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-product-categories)

- ### Document Addition Support for API Portal API Products

Document addition to API Products has been enabled on both API Manager and Portal sides. Users can create one or more documents for each API Product; these documents can be uploaded and edited as Markdown (.md) or HTML format files. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-product#documentation-management)

- ### API Portal API Product Visibility and Plan Management Support

Visibility and subscription plan (Plan) management of API Products has been centralized on both API Manager and Portal sides. With this feature, access level (Public, Private, Restricted) of each API Product can be determined, and subscription plans specific to different user groups can be defined, and who can see APIs and under what conditions they can be accessed can be flexibly controlled. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-product)

- ### Multi-Language Support Added to API Portal Settings

Multi-language support has been added to the Portal Settings screen. Portal interface language, contents, and system messages can now be managed in multiple languages. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-portal-settings)

- ### TR/EN Support for API Portal API Product Documentation Tab

The Document tab on the API Product page now supports creating Turkish and English content. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-product#documentation-management)

- ### "Code Samples" for API Portal Endpoints

A Code Samples section with multi-language support has been added to endpoint detail pages on API Portal. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-product)

- ### API Portal English Content Fields

Special fields have been defined for English page contents on API Portal. Thus, title, description, and text contents of each page can be entered separately in multiple languages and managed through the Portal interface. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-portal-settings)

- ### OpenAPI Addition Support for API Portal

The feature to directly add OpenAPI documents through API Portal has been enabled. Users can directly upload OpenAPI documents or automatically associate them from an external source using direct API Spec or External Spec options after selecting API Proxy and API Proxy Group. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-product)

- ### Customization of API Portal Login Emails

Emails sent during login to API Portal can now be customized according to corporate requirements. [See.](/en/api-portal/api-portal-settings)

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#bfdbfe', color: '#1e40af', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>IMPORTANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS</span>

- Operations performed on the Gateway Environments page have been made more controlled due to their system-wide impact, with each operation's function and effect explained to the user, and an additional approval mechanism added for critical actions. In the approval process, the user is required to manually enter the relevant Gateway name before the operation is performed.

- Error code colors on API Traffic and Trace screens have been made consistent with each other and within themselves, and a standard color palette has been applied for all error codes, increasing visual harmony and readability.

- Texts in the Log Connection field have been improved for readability.

- New WS-Security policies have been added to the response pipeline. These policies have been integrated into the section where existing JOSE policies are located. Also, the existing ws-sec-from-target policy has been moved to the area where JOSE policies are located in the response pipeline.

- WS Security From Target policy can now be applied not only in the response pipeline but also in the request pipeline.

- With the update made on the Management API side, the relativePath field used in API Proxy and Proxy Group objects has been removed and replaced with the ClientRoute object, which manages routing and access information more comprehensively.

- Key Value Map feature has been renamed as Environment Variable. According to the new positioning:
- It is located under Project menu → Development > Global Settings.
- It is displayed under Admin menu → Environments.

- Project Relative Path update operation has been separated from the existing flow and made an independent operation. Thus, only relative path changes are managed with a separate control and approval process, isolated from other project settings, reducing error risk.

- Relative-path-exist check has been removed, and the path validation and creation process has been reorganized with a new algorithm. In this context, all /api-proxies/relative-path-exist calls on the screen have been removed; path operations are now automatically executed through the updated internal algorithm.

- In the API Integration General Settings section, only the "Define API Integration (Task Flow) Module information" field is now present, and only Server URL information can be entered from here.
- The previously existing distinction "Kubernetes managed by Apinizer / managed by organization" has been removed.
- When server access cannot be established, it is clearly stated that certain operations cannot be performed, and appropriate warning messages are shown to the user.

- API Portal top menu bar has been moved to the left.

- Access to API Portal API cards could previously only be done by clicking on the text; now access can be done by clicking on the entire box.

- An indicator showing which document you are in has been added to the API Product Documentation tab; when Empty is selected while creating a new document, it is now added as HTML instead of Markdown; category field has been made mandatory when API Product is first created.

- A new tab called "Danger Zone" has been added to the API Product screen. In this tab, critical operations such as permanent deletion of the API are managed in a controlled manner.

- Label and category fields have been added to the API Portal - FAQ section; thus, FAQ contents are classified, making search and filtering operations easier.

- API Product Publish operation has been improved, making the publishing process more traceable and secure.

- Google SEO settings section has been added to the API Portal Settings screen, making search engine visibility and meta tag management of the portal configurable.

- A confirmation step has been added to the API Portal logout button to prevent user errors. When the logout operation is initiated, a confirmation window is shown to the user asking "Are you sure you want to close the session?"

- A "Close" button has been added to the application addition window (dialog) on API Portal, improving user experience.

- Broken dialog display in the application addition step within API Product has been fixed, and window alignment and style structure have been reorganized.

- Filtering has been arranged so that only published products are displayed on API Portal; unpublished products are now not displayed at all on the portal.

<Warning>
    With the new version, the `apimanager` image name should be used for the Apinizer Manager module. The old image name (`manager`) is not supported within the scope of updates.
</Warning>

<Warning>
    With the new version, the Access URL information belonging to the Integration module that will be accessed by Manager must be entered from the General Settings page, not from the Kubernetes Resources page. This method is now officially supported. After transitioning to this version, this setting must be entered manually for the integration to work properly.
</Warning>

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#e65a2a', color: '#ffffff', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>BUG FIXES</span>

**APNZ-5030** : On the Token log screen, when transitioning from a record with response body content to a record without content, the previous record's data continued to be displayed; this situation has been fixed, and data belonging to the current record is now shown correctly.

**APNZ-4867** : On the API Analytics screen, when wide date ranges are selected, data comes incorrectly in the "Most Active 10 Clients" graph.

**APNZ-5001** : Search function does not work in the selection window in the Variable / Context Values field, and screen components are not displayed correctly.

**APNZ-5055** : In the confirmation window shown during proxy deletion operation on the Proxy Group screen, \{\{id\}\} expression is displayed instead of proxy name.

**APNZ-5056** : On the Proxy Group screen, when multiple API Proxies are added quickly, the same proxy can be listed multiple times. Requests conflict and duplicate records can occur because the add button remains active before operations complete in the background.

**APNZ-5117** : In Traffic & Time Metrics reports, when Excel export is taken by selecting a project, all projects are exported instead of only the selected project.

**APNZ-5229** : When the pagination component opens in the Project selection field, it is displayed within the list.

**APNZ-5230** : JavaScript components on the IP Groups screen do not become active with page load; they only start working after user interaction.

**APNZ-5321** : When a policy in the All tab on the API Proxy screen is deleted, and then Proxy Key is changed, when the page is refreshed, the deleted policy is seen to be listed again. Policy deletion operation is not permanently applied after proxy key change.

**APNZ-5332** : In newly added WSDL API Proxies, the XML Error Template field in the Settings tab comes closed by default. Therefore, error messages are not published in Apinizer's standard output format; when XML Error Template is opened, the Content-Type field comes empty; in this case, error output cannot be created in the correct format. The field should come automatically with text/xml;charset=utf-8 value but returns empty.

**APNZ-5333** : Requests saved through Test Console in SOAP type APIs cannot be viewed again.

**APNZ-5222** : Environment list is not displayed in the Try It field on the Script2API screen.

**APNZ-5340** : Loading of files other than Cities is not prevented on the IP Geolocation screen. An informative warning message is not shown to the user in case of wrong file loading.

**APNZ-5192** : After deployment names are updated, sections belonging to Manager and Portal components on the Kubernetes Resources page become non-functional, and relevant pod lists cannot be displayed.

**APNZ-5265** : Menu components on the table on the Admin → Analytic → API Traffic page open on top of each other, causing display corruption. The same problem is also observed on the Development → API Proxies → API Traffic screen.

Also, when the number of items (25, 50, etc.) is changed through the paginator at the bottom of the page, the table continues to show only 10 records each time; the item count change is not reflected in the list.

**APNZ-5274** : Access to the Support Package Request page cannot be established. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Id must not be null! error is received in application logs.

**APNZ-5233** : Definition files on Apinizer can be accessed with all HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.); this access should be limited to GET method only.

**APNZ-5286** : When a Policy Group containing a JWT policy is added to an API Proxy using JWT authentication method, the existing JWT configuration defined in the proxy is deleted.

**APNZ-5254** : In an API Proxy with Swagger documentation and JWT Authentication structure, when method-based authentication policies are defined, endpoint-based authentication policies are lost when the proxy is duplicated or reparse operation is performed.

**APNZ-5297** : When Test Endpoint is run for the first time on API Proxy and Test Console screens, body content does not load; when the screen is closed and reopened, content is displayed correctly. Query parameters defined on the Test Console screen are not reflected in the generated cURL output.

**APNZ-5298** : On the Kubernetes Resources → Deployment & Services screen, the Node List field is shown as a required field in the user interface even though it is not required.

**APNZ-5299** : On the Gateway Environment screen, items in Unpublished status are incorrectly displayed in blue color; in this case, the visual status of items is not correctly reflected.

**APNZ-5301** : The Date Picker component used on the Report Generator screen looks different from the design on other pages and creates an inconsistent user experience. The warning icon on the same screen is not aligned in the center of the colored background it is on; the icon appears visually shifted upward.

**APNZ-5302** : Selection fields on the Method Settings screen of SOAP type API Proxies are positioned very close to each other, and alignment and spacing look irregular.

**APNZ-5309** : On the Connection Management → E-Mail → Project All screen, all records are listed regardless of which project the user selects; checkbox selection is non-functional.

**APNZ-5342** : Logs on the Application Logs page do not come sorted from newest to oldest.

**APNZ-5346** : On the API Proxy "Develop" tab, the selected HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) is not indicated as selected.

**APNZ-5337** : When Key Stores are created, after the save operation, the user is directly redirected to the list screen, and deploy status information is not displayed on the screen. After the "Save and Deploy" operation on the Key Stores screen, it returns to the list screen without showing which pods were deployed to.

**APNZ-5349** : Import operation cannot be performed in both Proxy and Policies sections in WS Security configurations.

**APNZ-5352** : "Stop" option should not be displayed in Redaction policies.

**APNZ-5359** : In WS Security policies, only KeyStore records in the project and global should be selectable; records in other projects should not be selectable.

**APNZ-5353** : "Redact By" field is not displayed in the interface in Redaction policies.

**APNZ-5373** : On the Monitoring → Uptime Monitor screen, after a new Notification is added and saved and re-entered, the Apply button only activates if a change is made in the name field.

**APNZ-5389:** Race condition situation that occurs when parse with wsdl is selected in XML Schema Validation policy should be fixed.

**APNZ-5391:** "Condition" values added to Rate Limit Control List settings are lost when saved.

**APNZ-5065:** gRPC type API Proxy does not work when API Root Context is defined.

**APNZ-5463** : Error is received when many Credentials are used on the RLCL screen.

**APNZ-5218** : In the JSON signing step on API Portal, the "Sign" button does not become active even though required fields are filled.

**APNZ-5227** : When switching between tabs on the Portal Test screen, updates made, for example, in the Body tab are lost when switching to the Headers tab and returning.

**APNZ-5228** : Portal main page opens in English by default; TR-ENG language selector does not work properly after version transition. Language change only becomes active when navigating to the APIs page and clicking the TR button.

**APNZ-5244** : When the same API Product is opened to multiple organizations, since only the user's own organization can be assigned to the user on the portal side, the system tries to validate all visibility organizations and access is incorrectly restricted.

**APNZ-4967** : WebSocket policies should also be executed for Connect method.

**APNZ-4966** : Authentication and similar policy errors or responses should be returned via WebSocket.

**APNZ-4965** : WebSocket does not receive XFF (X-Forwarded-For) information.

**APNZ-4952** : When project is exported/imported, the connection between global policies and global policies added to API Proxy/API Proxy Group breaks.

**APNZ-4950** : Issues occur when switching between tabs on the API Proxy Group page.

**APNZ-4948** : In Connection definitions, if you stay on the page after first creation and want to do another operation, "ID already exists" error is received.

**APNZ-4941** : Issues occur when Elasticsearch connection is created and saved; it is created in the background but not saved in the foreground.

**APNZ-4940** : Fields found with JsonPath, if they are nested map or list type, results are shown in a=b format.

**APNZ-4938** : Credential is lost after update on API Proxy ACL Method Authorization screen.

- When the page is refreshed, credential appears again, but a second update cannot be made without refreshing the page.

**APNZ-4936** : In Client Traffic & Time Metrics reports, requests coming to reverse proxy, durations, etc. appear as 0. The problem is only seen in reverse proxy; data is displayed correctly in proxies with endpoints.

**APNZ-4949** : When creating a project with Admin user, admin user is not automatically made owner.

**APNZ-4915** : When Credential is created, after "Save and Deploy" operation, it was returning to the list and API Proxy was being selected again. However, now it does not return to the list and API Proxy list cannot be selected.

**APNZ-4816** : In Mock API, only the last of the values we add with conditions into the 200 response works; others return 204.

## Version 2025.01.0

**Release Date: January 31, 2025**

<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#86efac', color: '#056d4f', padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem', borderRadius: '9999px', fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: '500' }}>FEATURED NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### New API Proxy Types: gRPC and WebSocket

Two new types have been added to API Proxy creation options: gRPC, WebSocket. [See.](/en/develop/api-proxy-creation/grpc-api-proxy-creation) [See WebSocket](/en/develop/api-proxy-creation/websocket-api-proxy-creation)

**gRPC Proxy Support:**

- Unary gRPC calls (single request from client, single response from server)

- Server streaming gRPC calls (single request from client, multiple response stream from server)

- Client streaming gRPC calls (multiple request stream from client, single response from server)

- Bidirectional streaming gRPC calls (bidirectional data stream from both client and server)

- gRPC-Web support (for browser-based gRPC communication)

- TLS/SSL secure connection support

**WebSocket Proxy Support:**

- Standard WebSocket protocol (ws://)

- Secure WebSocket protocol (wss://)

- Text message format

- Binary message format

Policies can be partially executed on API Proxies created in these two new types, and incoming and outgoing messages can be sent to log connectors.

Test console does not yet support these two protocols

- ### New Environments Suitable for New API Proxy Types

"Communication Protocol Type" field has been added to environments. API Proxy deployment environments have been arranged to automatically match according to proxy types. REST and SOAP API Proxies can be deployed to HTTP type environments, gRPC API Proxies to gRPC type environments, and WebSocket API Proxies to WebSocket type environments. With this update, proxy type and deployment environment compatibility is guaranteed, preventing wrong environment selections. [See.](/en/admin/server-management/environments)

**Unsupported Policies/Settings:** Ws Security Sts Token, mTLS Authentication, Script, Backend API Authentication, API Call, API Proxy Group, CORS Settings, Cache Settings, XML/ JSON Error Response Template, Load Balancing Type, Define Circuit Breaker, Define Client Flow Banner,  Define Proxy Server,  NTLM Settings, Customize Error Messages

- ### Geolocation Management with IP Control

IP controls can now be made according to Geolocation data (Country, City). [See.](/en/admin/system-settings/ip-geolocation-setting)

<Warning>
    Since the log data structure kept changes with this change, organizations using Elasticsearch need to update their log index template and perform rollover index. You can visit this page for the new index structure.
</Warning>


- ### Settings Group Management

The ability to create and assign Global Settings to both API Proxy and API Proxy Group has been enabled through the Settings Group screen. [See.](/en/develop/global-configurations/global-settings-group)

- ### Policy Group Management

The ability to create and assign Policy Groups to both API Proxy and API Proxy Group has been enabled through the Policy Group screen. [See.](/en/develop/global-configurations/policy-groups)

With this development, the structure of Policy Display screens has been redesigned to allow readonly user access in the future.

- ### Deployment Operations Synchronization and Result Display Improvement

Detailed results of all Deploy operations are now shown. [See.](/en/develop/deployment-and-version-management)
<Warning>
     With this development, comprehensive improvements have been made for pod deployment processes performed through Kubernetes service. In the previous version, in deployment operations sent from Manager to Worker, Worker was broadcasting this deployment asynchronously to other pods in its environment. Due to this structure, whether Worker successfully deployed to other pods could not be directly viewed on the Manager screen, and possible errors could only be detected from system logs. Also, since pod deployment statuses within namespace could not be tracked in real-time, unreachable pods could cause inconsistencies in the system.

    With the new development, the entire deployment process has been made synchronous. Communication between Manager and Worker has been strengthened, so when access to any pod cannot be established, errors are immediately caught and displayed on the Manager screen. Results of all pod deployment operations performed through Kubernetes service are now reported in detail in the user interface. Thanks to these improvements, transparency of the deployment process has been increased, and faster detection and management of errors has been facilitated. It should be noted that since the previously partially asynchronous process has been made completely synchronous, some increase in deployment times may be observed.

- "Redeploy All" option has been added to API Proxies and API Proxy groups using Global policies, policy groups, and Settings groups.

- Loading of settings and fonts in Portal has been arranged to be done automatically when the system is first opened.

- When a new API Proxy is created, the default value of the "Ignore Error Response Template In Case Of Error On Backend API" parameter in the Routing section has been set to false.

<Warning>
    **ATTENTION:** This change prevents security vulnerability formation in case of backend error by ensuring that error response returns with error response template.
</Warning>

- Formatted display of data in API Traffic log, Test Console Response Log, AuthToken Record Log, and Trace Logs has been removed to prevent misinterpretation risk. With this change, logs are presented as they are.

- Title and description section on API Portal API Product page has been made dynamic.

- Test button has been removed for undeployed environments in API Proxy Group endpoints tab.

- Members and Roles have been removed from the list on Admin Projects page, and Relative Path active, passive status and Relative Path if available have been added to the Table.

- Try It button visibility on API Portal has been made dynamic for each API Product.

- Supported Content-Encoding values for responses returned by API have been expanded. Previously only gzip, deflate, and br were supported; now gzip, deflate, br, compress, and zstd encoding types are also supported.
