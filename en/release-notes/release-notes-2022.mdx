## Version 2022.10.1

**Release Date: October 1, 2022**

<span style={{
    display: 'inline-block',
    backgroundColor: '#86efac',
    color: '#056d4f',
    padding: '0.25rem 0.75rem',

    fontSize: '0.875rem',
    fontWeight: '500'
}}>NEW FEATURE</span>

- ### Common Query Model (Data Model) Creation

Common Query Model is metadata information that describes what type of data is in the message (usually in the body section). Models created based on Global are used when designing API definition files.

- ### Kubernetes Resources Management

General settings related to Apinizer Platform's Environments, Pod Security Context definition, server configuration (Management Console, API Integrator, and API Portal), pod restart and disable/removal, monitoring all pods and accessing their logs, and monitoring Kubernetes cluster operations can be managed through the interface.

- ### ACL Report

ACL Report is a report screen that enables reaching information about which users from which organization can access which API Proxy, or which API Proxies users from which organization can access. Data such as Routing Address and Data Model belonging to access information can be viewed with filtering. Additionally, the output of the created report can be obtained as Excel.

- ### ACL Audit Records

ACL Audit Records displays records of operations of credentials that are approved or have their approval removed for access to API Proxy or API Proxy Group. Information such as operation date, operation type, reason, which user it applies to, which API Proxy/API Proxy Group and method it applies to are listed, and detailed filtering options are available.

- ### Management API

Apinizer Management APIs enable performing many operations such as API Parse, ReParse, Deploy, etc. without needing the screen application. Thus, Apinizer can be integrated into DevOps environments.

- ### Spec Design Editor Interface Renewed

Spec Design Editor allows creating a new API Definition Document by filling out forms through the interface or using existing API Definition Documents by importing them. This interface has been revised to improve user experience.

- ### Captcha Verification on Login Screen

To prevent malicious login to Apinizer Management Console, a limit has been placed on the number of incorrect logins a user can make. After the user exceeds the allowed number of incorrect logins in the first stage, captcha verification is activated and the user attempts login with the determined login attempt. If the user has exceeded the total allowed number of incorrect logins, they are locked and are no longer allowed to log into the application.

For a locked user to be able to log into the application again, this lock must be removed by an Admin from the Users page.

- ### User Removal from System on Idle Timeout

In Apinizer Management Console, the user's session is closed if they do not perform any operations on the application for a determined period.

- ### WS-Security STS Token Policy

The need to obtain a Token from Security Token Service for backend web services of SOAP type through Apinizer is resolved with this policy.

- ### Ability to Hide API Proxy Endpoints

For REST type API Proxies, by hiding at the API Proxy level, access to the entire API Definition File can be restricted, or by hiding at the method level, access to specified methods from the API Definition File can be restricted.

- ### Elasticsearch Snapshot Settings (Backup Settings)

Indexes in the defined Elasticsearch Cluster can be automatically backed up (snapshot) at determined time intervals. When this setting is configured, Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM) policy is defined on the cluster. Thus, backup settings can be managed on the cluster without needing another add-on, and history information containing result information of backups run can be monitored. Snapshot taking can be manually started when desired.

- ### API Portal Settings/Pages Customization

General settings (logo, title) on API Developer Portal and page contents or some fields (How It Works, FAQ, Login, Register) can be customized optionally. Thus, Portal Administrators can personalize the content their clients will use. In this way, content management can be done according to market dynamics and needs.
