<Info>
  There is no variable for the information about the result of the operation. Because it is not a data type suitable for other action types like connector.

  There is a special situation only in the email sending action. The result of the operation automatically comes as an email attachment by being zipped.

  If there is no attachment on the email, this means that this file hit the 25 mb size limit or no data was created in the result.
