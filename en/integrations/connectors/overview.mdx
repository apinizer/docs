title: "Overview"
description: "You can use connectors used in Task Flows and API traffic log management in Apinizer to perform integration components for database, message queues, email, file transfer, and logging operations. Connectors can connect to different systems, send data to these systems, or retrieve data from these systems."
---

<Info>
Connectors are used in two main areas: creating workflows in **Task Flows** (API Integrator) and sending API traffic logs to different systems in **Gateway Environments**. Each connector is customized to communicate with a specific system or protocol and can be easily used with form-based configuration without the need to write code.

## Module's Core Components

The Connectors module forms the foundation of integration and automation operations on the Apinizer platform. With this module:

    Performing file search, reading, and content retrieval in different formats using FTP connection definitions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="FTP List" icon="list" href="/en/integrations/connectors/ftp-list-connector">
    File listing and directory structure viewing operations on FTP servers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Communication and Notification Connectors

<Tip>
**Elasticsearch Connector** is particularly important. Querying and analytically visualizing API Traffic in Apinizer Management Console is only possible by adding Elasticsearch Connector to the relevant environment. Without Elasticsearch Connector, analytics screens, API Traffic tabs, and report generator menus cannot be used.
</Tip>

<Warning>
When connectors are used in Gateway Environments, the structure and privacy settings of API traffic logs are important. API Proxy Traffic Privacy Settings should be configured so that sensitive data does not appear explicitly in log records.
</Warning>
