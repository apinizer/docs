title: "Overview"
description: "API Integrator and Task Flow Manager is a workflow management system that can automatically execute multiple tasks in a specific order. Each task can use the output produced by the previous step, communicate with external systems, or perform operations defined in internal systems. Task flows can be automatically run with a scheduler, triggered by HTTP requests, and predefined operations can be performed in error situations. Monitoring and management of task flows is provided with detailed logging and statistics."
