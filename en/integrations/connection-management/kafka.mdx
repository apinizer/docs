## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I manage multiple topics with Kafka Connection?">
    <Info>
      The same Connection focuses on a single topic, but can be quickly duplicated for different topics; this way permissions and monitoring are kept separate.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can Enable Secure be left closed?">
    <Warning>
      It is possible for Development environment but not recommended to close TLS in Production; keep it open according to security policies.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How are secret values added to PropertiesMap?">
    <Info>
      When adding MapValue, select SECRET as valueType; UI masks values and stores them encrypted during export.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is ordering important in multi-broker configuration?">
    <Info>
      Broker list is tried according to the first reachable server; DNS round-robin or bootstrap list is recommended for high availability.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy if Test Connection fails?">
    <Warning>
      You can, but it is not recommended; Integration Flow will continue to give errors after Deployment. Fix the error in the test first.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using Connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Using Connection pool is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening a new connection for each request significantly increases performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended to create separate connections for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments in a single connection using the environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Connection is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. A different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not be deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not have been redeployed yet
