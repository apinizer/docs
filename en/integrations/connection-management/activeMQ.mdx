## Best Practices

### Things to Do and Best Practices

| Category | Description / Recommendations |
|----------|---------------------|
| Destination Management | **Bad:** Routing all workloads to a single queue.<br/><br/>**Good:** Defining separate Queue/Topic for different business types.<br/><br/>**Best:** Using own destination for each business type and documenting naming standards. |
| Protocol Selection | **Bad:** Using default TCP and ignoring security requirements.<br/><br/>**Good:** Preferring TCP in internal network, AMQP in external network.<br/><br/>**Best:** Providing encrypted communication using SSL/TLS supported AMQP |
| Session Acknowledgement Policy | **Bad:** Using AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE in all flows.<br/><br/>**Good:** Switching to CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE in critical operations.<br/><br/>**Best:** Using SESSION_TRANSACTED in transactional flows and applying rollback on failure. |
| Credential Management | **Bad:** Storing username/password as plain text.<br/><br/>**Good:** Masking in configuration file.<br/><br/>**Best:** Retrieving dynamically via Secret Manager or environment variable. |
| Observability | **Bad:** Not tracking connection logs.<br/><br/>**Good:** Monitoring basic error logs.<br/><br/>**Best:** Sending pool, timeout, and broker metrics to centralized monitoring system. |
| Environment Management | **Bad:** Using the same connection parameters in all environments.<br/><br/>**Good:** Creating separate connections for each environment.<br/><br/>**Best:** Managing all environments in a single connection using Environment option, only changing environment during inter-environment transitions. |
| Connection Test | **Bad:** Saving and deploying connection without testing.<br/><br/>**Good:** Verifying with Test Connection before saving.<br/><br/>**Best:** Testing after every parameter change, performing full integration test in test environment before moving to production. |

### Security Best Practices

| Security Area | Description / Warnings |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Broker Access Authorization | Allow only service accounts that need it. Apply role-based policies and remove unnecessary users. |
| Password Management | Periodically renew passwords, use minimum 16 characters, activate audit logs to prevent unauthorized sharing. |
| Durable Subscriber Protection | Keep Client IDs unique, do not use the same identity in multiple applications; otherwise message loss may occur. |
| Credential Management | Store sensitive information such as username and password using environment variable or secret manager. Do not hardcode credentials in code or configuration files. Periodically update passwords. |
| SSL/TLS Usage | Always enable SSL/TLS in Production environment. Use self-signed certificates only in development environment. Track certificate expiration dates and renew on time. |
| Access Control | Allow only authorized users to change Connection configuration. Store connection change logs. Apply change approval process for critical connections. |

### Things to Avoid

| Category | Description / Warnings |
|----------|---------------------|
| Wrong Destination Name | **Why to avoid:** Broker target cannot be found, messages are lost.<br/><br/>**Alternative:** Validate destination names in deployment pipeline. |
| Excessive Pool Size | **Why to avoid:** Resource consumption increases on broker side.<br/><br/>**Alternative:** Determine measured pool sizes according to traffic. |
| Non-Standard Encoding | **Why to avoid:** Consumers may not be able to decode the message.<br/><br/>**Alternative:** Maintain UTF-8 standard, coordinate if different encoding is needed. |
| Using Production Connection in Test Environment | **Why to avoid:** Test data can be written to production system, real users can be affected, security risk occurs.<br/><br/>**Alternative:** Create separate connections for each environment, use environment parameter, separate connection names by adding prefix according to environment (Test_, Prod_). |
| Very Low Timeout Values | **Why to avoid:** Connection constantly times out in network delays, requests fail.<br/><br/>**Alternative:** Adjust timeout values according to real usage scenarios, measure network latency and determine timeouts accordingly. |
| Not Using Connection Pool | **Why to avoid:** New connection is opened for every request, performance decreases, resource consumption increases, target system load increases.<br/><br/>**Alternative:** Activate connection pool, adjust pool size according to traffic volume, set up pool monitoring. |

### Performance Tips

| Criterion | Recommendation / Impact |
|--------|--------------|
| Broker Cluster Integration | **Recommendation:** Use failover URI structure (failover:(tcp://node1:61616,tcp://node2:61616)).<br/><br/>**Impact:** Automatic reconnection is provided in broker interruptions. |
| Message Throughput | **Recommendation:** Increase Send Timeout and Pool Size values in high volume sends.<br/><br/>**Impact:** Message queues are consumed without accumulation. |
| Ack Strategy | **Recommendation:** Provide manual control with CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE in critical flows.<br/><br/>**Impact:** Reduces message loss risk. |
| Connection Pool Optimization | **Recommendation:** Adjust pool size according to peak traffic (recommended: concurrent request count × 1.5), set idle connection timeouts, perform pool health check.<br/><br/>**Impact:** Connection opening cost decreases by 80%, response times decrease, resource usage is optimized. |
| Timeout Values Optimization | **Recommendation:** Measure real network latency, adjust timeout values accordingly, avoid very low or very high timeouts.<br/><br/>**Impact:** Unnecessary waits are prevented, fast fail-over is provided, user experience improves. |
| Connection Monitoring | **Recommendation:** Monitor connection pool usage, track timeout rates, perform connection health check, set up alerting.<br/><br/>**Impact:** Problems are detected proactively, performance bottlenecks are identified early, downtime decreases. |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Causes | Solution Steps |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Cannot Connect to Broker | - Wrong Broker URL<br/>- Firewall barrier<br/>- Broker service is down | 1. Verify Broker URL and port<br/>2. Test network access (telnet, nc)<br/>3. Check broker logs |
| Destination Not Found | - Queue/topic not created<br/>- Wrong name entered<br/>- Authorization missing | 1. Verify destination from broker management console<br/>2. Update connection parameter<br/>3. Check user permissions |
| Connection Timeout | - Network delay<br/>- Target system responding slowly<br/>- Timeout value too low | 1. Check network connectivity<br/>2. Check target system health<br/>3. Increase timeout values<br/>4. Review connection logs |
| Authentication Failed | - Wrong username/password<br/>- Expired credentials<br/>- Authorization problem | 1. Verify credentials<br/>2. Check that user is active in target system<br/>3. Check that necessary permissions are granted<br/>4. Check SSL/TLS certificates |
| Pool Exhausted | - Pool size too low<br/>- Connection leak exists<br/>- Traffic too high | 1. Increase pool size<br/>2. Check that connections are properly closed<br/>3. Set idle connection timeouts<br/>4. Monitor connection usage metrics |
| Connection Test Successful But Integration Flow Gives Error | - Different connection may be selected in Integration/Connector step<br/>- Step may be misconfigured<br/>- Flow/Job may not be redeployed | 1. Check that Connection's enable toggle is active<br/>2. Verify that correct connection is selected in Integration Flow<br/>3. Redeploy Connection<br/>4. Redeploy Integration Flow or Job<br/>5. Check Gateway logs |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

| Category | Question | Answer |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| General | Can I manage multiple destinations within the same broker with a single connection? | Yes, the same Apache ActiveMQ connection can be used with different destinations in different Integration Flow steps; target destination configuration must be done separately in each step. |
| General | Does message consumption completely stop when connection is disabled? | When disabled, the connection is not reused, integration steps return error or force connection selection. |
| Technical | What settings should I change to switch from AMQP to TCP? | Set ActiveMQ Connection Protocol Type value to TCP, update Broker URL to tcp:// or ssl:// schema, check firewall ports. |
| Technical | How is durable topic subscription activated? | Set Destination Type=TOPIC, enter ClientID field uniquely and enable durable subscriber option on Integration Flow side. |
| Usage | Is automatic retry performed on connection if queue is full? | If broker side returns error, ActiveMQ client retries; still you need to track application logs and do capacity planning. |
| General | Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows? | Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken. |
| Technical | Is using connection pool mandatory? | Using connection pool is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening new connections for every request significantly improves performance. |
| Usage | Should I create different connections for Test and Production? | Yes, it is recommended to create separate connections for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments within a single connection using the environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk. |
| Technical | Test Connection is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why? | Several reasons may exist: 1) Connection enable toggle may be passive, 2) A different connection may be selected in Integration step, 3) Connection may not be deployed, 4) Integration Flow may not have been redeployed yet. |
