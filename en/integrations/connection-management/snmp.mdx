    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>

#### Configuration Steps

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigating to Creation Page">
        - Go to **Connection → SNMP** section from the left menu.
        - Click the **[+ Create]** button at the top right.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Entering Basic Information">
        **Enable Status (Active Status):**

        - Set active/passive status with toggle. New connections are active by default.

        **Name - Required:**

        - Example: `Production_SNMP`
        - Enter a unique name, cannot start with space.
        - System automatically checks. Green checkmark: available. Red cross: existing name.

        **Description:**

        - Example: "SNMP trap collector"
        - Max. 1000 characters.
        - Describe the purpose of the connection.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Environment Selection">
        - Select environment from dropdown menu: **Development**, **Test**, or **Production**.
        - Different connection parameters can be defined for each environment.
    </Step>

    <Step title="SNMP Basic Parameters">
        - Fill in **Version**, **Connection String**, **Message Type**, **Retry Count**, and **Timeout** fields.
        - Write the correct port according to device documentation, adjust retryCount value according to network quality, remember that timeout value is in seconds.
    </Step>

    <Step title="OID and Message Maps">
        - Determine **PDU OID for Message/Time** fields according to your device's MIB files.
        - If additional fields are needed, add OID and the field name to be read as key/value to the **PDU Variable Map** table.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Timeout and Connection Pool Settings">
        - Review connection/request timeout values in milliseconds in the advanced section.
        - Determine concurrent trap processing capacity with **Pool Size** and enter a value appropriate for network delay for **SNMP Retry Interval**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Security and Authentication Settings">
        - If you selected SNMPv3, determine **Security Level**.
        - When **Enable User Authentication** is enabled, select USM Authentication/Privacy protocols, set passphrase fields to at least 8 characters, and use secret manager information.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test Connection">
        - Click the **[Test Connection]** button.
        - Test whether connection parameters are correct.
        - **Success:** Green confirmation message
        - **Failed:** Error details are shown
    </Step>

    <Step title="Saving">
        - Click the **[Save and Deploy]** button at the top right.

        **Checklist:**

        - Unique name
        - Required fields filled
        - Test connection successful (recommended)

        **Result:**

        - Connection is added to the list
        - Becomes available in Integration Flow and Connector steps
        - Becomes active according to environment
        
        <Check>
          Connection created successfully! You can now use it in Integration Flow and Connector steps.
        </Check>
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting a Connection

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Alternative: Deactivation" icon="toggle-off">
    Use the **Disable** option instead of deleting. Connection becomes passive but is not deleted. Can be reactivated when needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Exporting/Importing Connections

<Info>
In this step, users can export existing connections for backup, migration to different environments, or sharing purposes, or import a previously exported connection again. This operation is used to maintain data integrity in version management, transitions between test and production environments, or inter-team sharing processes.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do's and Best Practices">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Trap Addressing" icon="send">
        **Bad:** Leaving all devices with a single community

      </Card>
      <Card title="OID Management" icon="map">
        **Bad:** Leaving PDU Variable Map empty

      </Card>
      <Card title="Retry/Timeout Setting" icon="clock">
        **Bad:** Leaving default retryCount and timeout values in every environment  
        **Good:** Updating retryCount according to network quality  
        **Best:** Measuring latency in Prod environment and optimizing timeout/interval values with data
      </Card>
      <Card title="Flow Integration" icon="workflow">
        **Bad:** Using the same connection in independent flows without version control

        **Best:** Versioning the exported connection with Git repository or artifact management and matching with flow changes
      </Card>
      <Card title="Environment Management" icon="layers">
        **Bad:** Using the same connection parameters in all environments  
        **Good:** Creating separate connection for each environment

      </Card>
      <Card title="Connection Test" icon="check-circle">
        **Bad:** Saving and deploying connection without testing  
        **Good:** Validating with Test Connection before saving

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which versions does SNMP Connection support?">
    <Info>
      V1, V2c, and V3 are supported; USM security options open when V3 is selected.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I send both trap and inform with the same connection?">
    <Info>
      No, message type takes a single value. You need to create two connections for two different types or duplicate with export/import.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is PDU Variable Map used for?">
    <Info>
      Provides readable field names on the Integration Flow side by mapping OID field names and allows you to easily add new OIDs.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How should security level selection be in SNMPv3?">
    <Info>
      AUTH_PRIV is recommended if device supports it; in this case, you need to select authentication and privacy protocols and enter passwords.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if trap port is closed?">
    <Warning>
      If UDP 162 is blocked, connection falls to timeout. Request firewall rule opening from network team and run Test Connection.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Using connection pool is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening new connection for each request significantly increases performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended to create separate connection for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments within a single connection using the environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection Test is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. Different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not be deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not be redeployed yet
