    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>

#### Configuration Steps

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Creation Page">
        - Go to **Connection → Webhook Integration** section from the left menu.
        - Click the **[+ Create]** button in the top right.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enter Basic Information">
        **Enable Status (Active Status):**

        - Set active/passive status with toggle. New connections are active by default.

        **Name - Mandatory:**

        - Example: `Production_Webhook`
        - Enter a unique name, should not start with space.
        - System automatically checks. Green checkmark: available. Red cross: existing name.

        **Description:**

        - Example: "Prod log forwarding webhook"
        - Max. 1000 characters.
        - Describe the purpose of the Connection.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Environment Selection">
        - Select environment from dropdown menu: **Development**, **Test**, or **Production**.
        - Different connection parameters can be defined for each environment.
    </Step>

    <Step title="HTTP Connection Parameters">
        - Select GET/POST/PUT etc. from **HTTP Method** list.
        - Enter full endpoint starting with https:// in **Full URL** field.
        - Use placeholders for query parameters or path variables if necessary.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Header Management">
        - Add new row with **+** in **Headers** tab.
        - **Header Name** and **Header Value** fields cannot be left empty.
        - You can select common headers from auto-completion list.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Timeout and Connection Pool Settings">
        - **Timeout** field in **Settings** tab determines maximum duration (seconds) for request completion.
        - Pool size is managed server-side, so only timeout value is changed in UI.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Security and Authentication Settings">
        - Write API keys or Bearer tokens in **Authorization** header.
        - Create Authorization: Basic ... if basic HTTP auth is required.
        - SSL/TLS protection is provided with HTTPS URLs; configure certificate connection at environment level for mutual TLS if needed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test Connection">
        - Click the **[Test Connection]** button.
        - Test whether connection parameters are correct.
        - **Success:** Green confirmation message
        - **Failed:** Error details are shown
    </Step>

    <Step title="Saving">
        - Click the **[Save and Deploy]** button in the top right.

        **Checklist:**

        - Unique name
        - Mandatory fields filled
        - Test connection successful (recommended)

        **Result:**

        - Connection is added to the list
        - Becomes available for use in Integration Flow and Connector steps
        - Becomes active according to environment
        
        <Check>
          Connection created successfully! You can now use it in Integration Flow and Connector steps.
        </Check>
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting Connection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deletion Process" icon="trash">
    Select **Delete** from the **⋮** menu at the end of the row or click the **[Delete]** button on the connection detail page
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Deletion Tips" icon="info-circle">
    **Check Before Deleting:** It may be used in Integration Flow or Connector steps. If necessary, assign an alternative connection. Back up with **Export** before deleting
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Alternative: Deactivation" icon="toggle-off">
    Use the **Disable** option instead of deleting. Connection becomes passive but is not deleted. Can be reactivated when needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Exporting/Importing Connection

<Info>
In this step, users can export existing connections for backup, transfer to different environments, or sharing purposes, or import a previously exported connection again. This process is used to maintain data integrity in version management, transitions between test and production environments, or inter-team sharing processes.

      </Card>
      <Card title="Connection Test" icon="check-circle">
        **Bad:** Saving and deploying the connection without testing  
        **Good:** Validating with Test Connection before saving  
        **Best:** Testing after every parameter change, performing full integration test in test environment before going to production

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same webhook connection for both Slack and Teams?">
    <Info>
      The same connection routes to a single URL. You need to create different connections for different platforms or make the URL parametric.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why does Name field give error before saving?">
    <Info>
      If there is a connection with the same name in the list, service returns nameExist=true and does not allow saving. Update the name to be unique.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many rows can I add to Header table?">
    <Info>
      There is no limit but name and value fields of each row must be filled; otherwise saving is blocked.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What unit does Timeout field work in?">
    <Info>
      UI takes value in seconds and backend converts this value to milliseconds and transfers it to HTTP client.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="In which environment does Test Connection run?">
    <Info>
      It runs on Publication Worker according to the environment ID you selected and tries to reach the real endpoint.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using Connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Using Connection pool is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening a new connection for each request significantly increases performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended to create separate connections for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments in a single connection using the environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Connection is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. A different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not be deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not have been redeployed yet
