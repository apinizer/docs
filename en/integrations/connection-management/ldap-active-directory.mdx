## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I define multiple Base DNs in LDAP connection?">
    <Info>
      A single connection only takes one Base DN; you need to create separate connections for different OUs or define alternative steps within Flow.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why does Test Connection become passive when I use environment variable?">
    <Info>
      If Server Address, Username, Password, or Base DN starts with a variable, values are resolved at deployment time; Test Connection enters overlay because it cannot see the real value.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What do EnumSearchScope values do?">
    <Info>
      OBJECT searches only a single entry, ONE_LEVEL searches the first level of the specified OU, SUBTREE searches entries in the entire subtree; selection is made according to performance requirements.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What should I do if certificate appears in revoked list?">
    <Warning>
      Renew the certificate via Secret Manager or select a different certificateId; bind is blocked with revoked certificates according to requireCertificateType setting.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How are parameters affected when I change Environment selection?">
    <Info>
      Separate values are stored for each environment; when you change the environment, the form is updated with relevant values and only the selected environment is affected after Save and Deploy.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Using connection pool is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening new connections for every request significantly improves performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended to create separate connections for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments within a single connection using the environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Connection is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. A different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not be deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not have been redeployed yet
