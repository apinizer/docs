title: "Overview"
description: "Defines and manages connection configurations used for integration with external systems in Apinizer. Connection Configurations are external resources used in Apinizer. You can integrate with external systems when anomaly situations occur or when database connection is required with DB-2-API. Under the Project menu, operations can be performed only on connection definitions belonging to the project, while under the Admin menu, definitions defined in all projects can be viewed. Export/Import operations can be performed for all connection configurations, and they can be made available for use in all projects by moving them to Admin page with the Globalize option"
