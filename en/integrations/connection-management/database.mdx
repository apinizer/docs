    </Step>

    <Step title="Entering Basic Information">
        **Enable Status (Active Status):**

        Set active/passive status with toggle. New connections are active by default.

        **Name (Name) Required:**

        Example: `Production_DBPool`

        - Enter unique name, should not start with space.
        - System automatically checks. Green checkmark: available. Red X: existing name.

        **Description (Description):**

        Example: "Reporting queries of Order service"

        - Max. 1000 characters.
        - Describe the purpose of Connection.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Environment Selection">
        - Select environment from dropdown menu: Development, Test, or Production.
        - Different connection parameters can be defined for each environment.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Database Type and JDBC URL">
        - Select target driver from Database Type list; recommended JDBC template comes automatically.
        - Edit JDBC / Connection URL field or bind environment variable with Select Variable button.
        - Add driver-specific parameters in URL for MongoDB and Trino.
        
        <Tip>
          You can use the same connection for different environments using environment variable.
        </Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Credentials and Credentials">
        - If Use Credentials is selected, username/password fields become visible.
        - Enter value for each field or select variable with environment variable autocomplete.
        - Use Credentials can be turned off for unique URI that does not require credentials (e.g., Mongo SRV).
    </Step>

    <Step title="Timeout and Connection Pool Settings">
        - Adjust pool parameters such as Initial/Min/Max Pool Size, Increment Count, Max Statements according to traffic volume.
        - Enter Connection Timeout, Idle Connection Test Period, Max Idle Time, Max Connection Age values in milliseconds.
        - Configure Test Connection On Checkout/Checkin checkboxes for drivers other than MongoDB/Trino.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Security and Authentication Settings">
        - Add ssl=true or similar parameter to JDBC URL for databases requiring SSL/TLS.
        - Hide secrets using environment variable for LDAP or vault-based credentials.
        - Do not use plain text password in Production environment.
        
        <Warning>
          Always use SSL/TLS in Production environment and manage passwords through secret manager.
        </Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test Connection">
        - Click [Test Connection] button.
        - Test whether connection parameters are correct.
        - Successful: Green confirmation message, Failed: Error details are shown.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Saving">
        - Click [Save and Deploy] button in the top right.

        **Checklist:**
        - Unique name
        - Required fields filled
        - Test connection successful (recommended)

        **Result:**
        - Connection is added to list.
        - Becomes available for use in Integration Flow and Connector steps.
        - Becomes active according to environment.
        
        <Check>
          Connection created successfully! You can now use it in Integration Flow and Connector steps.

    **Alternative: Deactivate**
    - Use Disable option instead of deleting.
    - Connection becomes passive but is not deleted.
    - Can be reactivated when needed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Exporting/Importing Connection

        **Why to avoid:** New connection opens on each request, performance decreases, resource consumption increases, target system load increases.  
        **Alternative:** Enable Connection pool, adjust pool size according to traffic volume, set up pool monitoring.

### Performance Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Query Density Management" icon="chart-line">
    **Recommendation:** Create separate connection definitions for intensive SELECT/INSERT flows.  
    **Effect:** Reduces pool starvation risk, response times are balanced.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Read/Write Separation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Recommendation:** Use different Connection for read replica and primary DB.  
    **Effect:** Replica performance is maintained, write operations are not affected.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Ready JDBC Templates" icon="file-code">
    **Recommendation:** Edit automatically filled JDBC URLs according to project standard and save as template.  
    **Effect:** Time to open new connection shortens, error rate decreases.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Connection Pool Optimization" icon="layer-group">
    **Recommendation:** Adjust pool size according to peak traffic (recommended: concurrent request count × 1.5), set idle connection timeouts, perform pool health check.  
    **Effect:** Connection opening cost decreases by 80%, response times decrease, resource usage is optimized.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Timeout Values Optimization" icon="clock">
    **Recommendation:** Measure real network latency, adjust timeout values accordingly, avoid very low or very high timeouts.  
    **Effect:** Unnecessary waits are prevented, fast fail-over is provided, user experience improves.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Connection Monitoring" icon="chart-bar">
    **Recommendation:** Monitor Connection pool usage, track timeout rates, perform connection health check, set up alerting.  
    **Effect:** Problems are detected proactively, performance bottlenecks are identified early, downtime decreases.

      No, URI field works in mongodb:// format for MongoDB and Increment Count, Max Statements fields are automatically hidden.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Which fields control pool tests?">
    <Info>
      Test Connection On Checkout/Checkin checkboxes are active in JDBC types using c3p0 driver; they are disabled in MongoDB and Trino.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where do I see deployment result errors?">
    <Info>
      Error messages, log links, and return actions are listed in the DeploymentResult window that opens after Save/Test operation.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides central management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, care should be taken as changes made to connection will affect all usage locations.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using Connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Connection pool usage is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening new connection on each request significantly increases performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended that you create separate connection for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments within a single connection using environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Connection successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. Different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not have been deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not have been redeployed yet
