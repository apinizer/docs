    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Creation Page">
    - Go to **Connection → Logback** section from left menu.
    - Click **[+ Create]** button at top right.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Basic Information">
    **Enable Status (Active Status):** Set active/passive status with toggle. New connections are active by default.

    **Name Required:**
    Example: `Production_Logback`
    - Enter unique name, cannot start with space.
    - System automatically checks. Green checkmark: available. Red X: existing name.

    **Description:**
    Example: "API proxy traffic logs"
    - Max. 1000 characters.
    - Describe the purpose of the Connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment Selection">
    - Select environment from dropdown menu: **Development**, **Test**, or **Production**.
    - Different connection parameters can be defined for each environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Logback Specific Parameters - Directory and Naming">
    - Enter absolute directory that worker node can write to in **logPath** field.
    - Determine RollingFileAppender file cycle with **logFileName** and **logFilenamePattern** fields; pay attention to containing date and index.
    - Unauthorized directories produce errors during deployment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Logback Specific Parameters - Content and Format">
    - Fill **logPattern** field with Logback conversion patterns, add thread name or request-id if needed.
    - Use **logPodName** field if routing to specific pod is required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Timeout and Connection Pool Settings">
    - Logback file writing has no separate timeout; if needed, update flush interval settings at JVM level through deployment descriptor.
    - Set **maxFileSize**, **maxHistory**, **totalSizeCap** values appropriately according to operation policies for disk quotas.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Security and Authentication Settings">
    - Ensure worker node user account has write permission on **logPath**.
    - Use file system ACLs or Kerberos-supported share points if needed.
    - In production environment, allow only authorized service accounts to access shared directories.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    - Click **[Test Connection]** button.
    - Test whether connection parameters are correct.
    - Success: Green confirmation message, Failed: Error details shown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    - Click **[Save and Deploy]** button at top right.

    **Checklist:** Unique name. Required fields filled. Test connection successful (recommended)

    **Result:**
    - Connection is added to list.
    - Becomes available in Integration Flow and Connector steps.
    - Becomes active according to environment.
    
    <Check>
      Connection created successfully! You can now use it in Integration Flow and Connector steps.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What minimum parameters should I enter for Logback Connection?">
    <Info>
      Name, logPath, logFileName, logFilenamePattern, logPattern, and all limit fields must be filled; others are optional but recommended.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer logs to both file and external system simultaneously?">
    <Check>
      Yes, while Logback Connection writes to file, REST API or Message Queue outputs can be defined with parallel Connector steps in Integration Flow.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I leave logPodName value empty?">
    <Info>
      When left empty, all worker pods rotate under same logPath; safe to leave empty if you won't track specific pods.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If maxHistory and totalSizeCap conflict, which takes priority?">
    <Info>
      Logback first cleans according to maxHistory value, then continues deleting oldest files if totalSizeCap overflow continues.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I transfer logs to external SIEM tool?">
    <Info>
      When rolling files complete, external agents or cron jobs can read logPath and push to SIEM; keep file pattern compatible with SIEM expectations.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Connection pool usage is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening new connection on every request significantly increases performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended to create separate connection for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments in a single connection using environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Connection is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. Different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not be deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not be redeployed yet
  </Accordion>
