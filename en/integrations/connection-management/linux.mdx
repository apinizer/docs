    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
#### Configuration Steps

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Creation Page">
        - Go to **Connection → Linux Script** section from left menu.
        - Click **[+ Create]** button at top right.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enter Basic Information">
        **Enable Status (Active Status):**

        - Set active/passive status with toggle. New connections are active by default.

        **Name - Required:**

        - Example: `Production_LinuxScript`
        - Enter unique name, cannot start with space.
        - System automatically checks. Green checkmark: available. Red X: existing name.

        **Description:**

        - Example: "Prod node restart scripts"
        - Max. 1000 characters.
        - Describe the purpose of the Connection.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Environment Selection">
        - Select environment from dropdown menu: **Development**, **Test**, or **Production**.
        - Different connection parameters can be defined for each environment.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Linux Server Parameters">
        - **Host Name:** Enter Linux server where script will run with fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP.
        - **SSH Port:** Default is 22; if security policy is different, write new port and ensure it's opened in firewall.
        - Host access should be tested from worker; inaccessible servers will error during save.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Credentials and Script Permissions">
        - **Username:** Use service user with only necessary directory/script permissions.
        - **Password:** Password field is tested before saving and stored encrypted in database.
        - Ensure user has execute permission on target scripts.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Timeout and Connection Pool Settings">
        - Adjust connection timeout, request timeout, and pool size values according to workload.
        - Prevent SSH session from closing by reducing keep-alive interval for long-running commands.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Security and Authentication Settings">
        - Fill credentials from secret manager or environment variable.
        - If SSL/TLS tunneling is required, configure port forwarding through bastion host.
        - Do not use root account; define only service user with necessary permissions.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test Connection">
        - Click **[Test Connection]** button.
        - Test whether connection parameters are correct.
        - **Success:** Green confirmation message
        - **Failed:** Error details are shown
    </Step>

    <Step title="Save">
        - Click **[Save and Deploy]** button at top right.

        **Checklist:**

        - Unique name
        - Required fields filled
        - Test connection successful (recommended)

        **Result:**

        - Connection is added to list
        - Becomes available in Integration Flow and Connector steps
        - Becomes active according to environment
        
        <Check>
          Connection created successfully! You can now use it in Integration Flow and Connector steps.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can different projects share the same Linux Script connection?">
    <Info>
      No, each connection belongs to a specific project; if sharing is needed, export/import or move-to-global operation should be applied.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is automatic retry performed when script fails?">
    <Info>
      No, connector performs single execution. If retry is needed, Retry step should be configured in Integration Flow.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How are passwords stored?">
    <Info>
      Passwords entered through UI are encrypted when saved, decrypted only at runtime on worker side with UtilCommon.decryptWithDefaultAlgorithm.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What command does Test Connection execute?">
    <Info>
      During save, ls command is triggered via UtilRemoteLinux.runLinuxCommand; thus SSH and permission validation is performed.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I use script output in other steps?">
    <Info>
      You can select output keys returned from Connector as variables in subsequent steps within Integration Flow; get only necessary fields with JSON path settings.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same connection in multiple Integration Flows?">
    <Check>
      Yes, the same connection can be used in multiple Integration Flow or Connector steps. This provides centralized management and guarantees configuration consistency. However, changes made to the connection will affect all usage locations, so care should be taken.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is using connection pool mandatory?">
    <Info>
      Connection pool usage is not mandatory but strongly recommended in high-traffic systems. Reusing existing connections instead of opening new connection on every request significantly increases performance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I create different connections for Test and Production?">
    <Check>
      Yes, it is recommended to create separate connection for each environment. Alternatively, you can manage all environments in a single connection using environment parameter. This approach provides easier management and less error risk.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Connection is successful but not working in Integration Flow, why?">
    <Warning>
      Several reasons may exist:
    </Warning>
    
    1. Connection enable toggle may be passive
    2. Different connection may be selected in Integration step
    3. Connection may not be deployed
    4. Integration Flow may not be redeployed yet
