The Settings Group screen is used to configure and edit settings specific to API Proxies or API Proxy Groups. It allows grouping and applying different settings. Existing setting groups can be edited, made default, or new settings can be defined to customize the behavior of API Proxies/API Proxy Groups.

Settings Group settings are shown in the following image:

| **Description** | Descriptive information about the settings group. |
| **Default for API Proxies** <em>(Default for API Proxies)</em> | Determines whether this settings group is the default setting for newly created API Proxies/API Proxy Groups. "Set Default" option from the "Actions" menu can be used to make it default. |
| **Actions** <em>(Actions)</em> | - **Edit** <em>(Edit)</em>: Provides the ability to edit the existing settings group.<br />- **Set Default** <em>(Set Default)</em>: Makes the settings group default for new API Proxies/API Proxy Groups.<br /><br /><Info>If "Set Default" <em>(Set Default)</em> setting is selected, if there is a settings group marked as default, the default property on it is removed. Existing API Proxies/API Proxy Groups are not affected by this change. New API Proxies and API Proxy Groups created after this setting are created with this new setting as default.</Info> |

Settings created on the API Proxy Settings screen can be assigned to proxies and proxy groups. This operation is performed through a selection screen as shown in the image.

Settings for adding API Proxy settings to Proxy and Proxy Group are shown in the following images:

<img src="/images/develop/global-configurations/global-settings-group-3.png" alt="Adding API Proxy Settings 2" style={{maxWidth: '1000px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

- The user can select one or more of the listed API Proxies.
- Similarly, API Proxy Settings can also be assigned to Proxy groups from the same screen.

## Settings Group Deploy Operation

When any change is made to a settings group, the status of API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this group changes to "Redeploy Required". Instead of deploying them one by one, the "Settings Group Deploy" feature enables bulk deployment of all API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this settings group to a specific working environment *(environment)*.

When the deploy operation is completed, a results screen named **Deployment Results** showing the result of the deploy operation is presented to the user.

Settings Group Deploy detail is shown in the following image:
