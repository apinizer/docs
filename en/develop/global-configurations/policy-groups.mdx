title: "Policy Groups"
description: "You can provide centralized management by grouping multiple policies. You can add local or global policies to groups, determine execution order, and manage active/inactive statuses. You can bulk assign grouped policies to API Proxies and API Proxy Groups and perform bulk deploy operations."
---

The Policy Group screen is used to group multiple policies for use. Grouped policies can be added as a group in the API Proxy/API Proxy Group page like adding policies, or can be connected to API Proxies and API Proxy Groups according to a specific execution order when creating. Users can add desired local or global policies to the group with the 'Add Policy' button and arrange their order, and if desired, make the policy status active/inactive.

<Info>
You can visit the [Policies (Policies)](/en/develop/policies/api-based-throttling) page for policy details.

| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Name used for Policy Group. |
| **Description** | Descriptive information can be added about the Policy Group. |
| **Add Policy** | Used to create a new policy and add it to the list. Each added policy is applied according to the execution order determined on the Proxy. Ordering can be changed through drag icons on the screen. |

The created Policy group can be assigned to proxies and proxy groups.

The list of API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using the Policy group is shown in the following image:

## Policy Group Deploy Operation

When any change is made to a policy group, the status of API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this group changes to "Redeploy Required". Instead of deploying them one by one, the "Policy Group Deploy" feature enables bulk deployment of all API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this policy group to a specific working environment *(environment)*.

When the deploy operation is completed, a results screen named **Deployment Results** showing the result of the deploy operation is presented to the user.

Policy Group Deploy detail is shown in the following image:
