description: "You can provide centralized policy management independent of API Proxies. You can create, import, and export global policies. When you update a policy, you affect all API Proxies using that policy. You can convert local policies to global form and perform bulk deploy operations."

Global policies can be created independently of API Proxies from the Global Policies interfaces or from an API Proxy's [Development Tab](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/policy-management).

## Features of Global Policies

- **Independence**: Global policies can be created and managed independently of API Proxies.
- **Reusability**: A global policy can be used by multiple API Proxies.
- **Centralized Update**: Updates made to a global policy affect all API Proxies using that policy.
- **Interaction**: When an API Proxy is deleted, global policies used by that API Proxy are not affected. However, any update made to a global policy affects all API Proxies using that policy.

Operations that can be performed with Global Policies:

- [Import Global Policies](/en/admin/secrets-management/export-import)
- [Export Global Policies](/en/admin/secrets-management/export-import)

## Global Policies Deploy Operation

When any change is made to a global policy, the status of API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this policy changes to "Redeploy Required". Instead of deploying them one by one, the deploy feature on this page enables bulk deployment of all API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this policy to a specific working environment *(environment)*.

When the deploy operation is completed, a results screen named **Deployment Results** showing the result of the deploy operation is presented to the user.

Global Policies Deploy detail is shown in the following image:

## Globalizing Local Policy

While in the Development tab of an API Proxy, you can make any policy you create a global policy by pressing the "Add The Policy As a Global Policy" button in the upper right area and entering a name in the "Name" field that opens.

The settings for converting a policy to global form through a Plain-Text Authentication policy set locally are shown in the following image:
