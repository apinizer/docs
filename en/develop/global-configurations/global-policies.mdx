description: "You can provide centralized policy management independent of API Proxies. You can create, import, and export global policies. When you update a policy, you affect all API Proxies using that policy. You can convert local policies to global form and perform bulk deploy operations."
---

Global policies can be created independently of API Proxies from the Global Policies interfaces or from an API Proxy's [Development Tab](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/policy-management).

## Features of Global Policies

- **Independence**: Global policies can be created and managed independently of API Proxies.
- **Reusability**: A global policy can be used by multiple API Proxies.
- **Centralized Update**: Updates made to a global policy affect all API Proxies using that policy.
- **Interaction**: When an API Proxy is deleted, global policies used by that API Proxy are not affected. However, any update made to a global policy affects all API Proxies using that policy.

Operations that can be performed with Global Policies:

- [Import Global Policies](/en/admin/secrets-management/export-import)
- [Export Global Policies](/en/admin/secrets-management/export-import)

## Global Policies Deploy Operation

When any change is made to a global policy, the status of API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this policy changes to "Redeploy Required". Instead of deploying them one by one, the deploy feature on this page enables bulk deployment of all API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this policy to a specific working environment *(environment)*.

When the deploy operation is initiated, a confirmation dialog opens. This dialog contains the following information and options:

- **Policy/Settings Group Name**: The name of the global policy to be deployed is displayed. This information is shown in the confirmation mechanism since it is a bulk operation.
- **API Proxy and API Proxy Group Selection**: You can select whether the deploy operation will be applied to API Proxies, API Proxy Groups, or both. Both options can be selected.
- **Filter Option**: You can select one of the following options to filter which API Proxies and API Proxy Groups will be deployed:
  - **All**: All API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using this global policy are deployed.
  - **Only deployed ones**: Only API Proxies and API Proxy Groups that are deployed in the selected environment and do not require redeploy are deployed.
  - **Only deployed and redeploy required ones**: Only API Proxies and API Proxy Groups that are deployed in the selected environment and require redeploy are deployed.
- **Deployable Object Counts**: The number of API Proxies and API Proxy Groups to be deployed is displayed according to the selected filter option.

When the filter option is changed, the deployable object counts are automatically updated. When the deploy operation is initiated, the API Proxies and API Proxy Groups determined according to the selected filter option are deployed.

When the deploy operation is completed, a results screen named **Deployment Results** showing the result of the deploy operation is presented to the user.

## Globalizing Local Policy

While in the Development tab of an API Proxy, you can make any policy you create a global policy by pressing the "Add The Policy As a Global Policy" button in the upper right area and entering a name in the "Name" field that opens.

The settings for converting a policy to global form through a Plain-Text Authentication policy set locally are shown in the following image:
