  **Demo Environment** You can experience what is described here in the demo environment at [demo.apinizer.com](https://demo.apinizer.com/). If you haven't created one yet, [sign up](https://demo.apinizer.com/register) to create a user for yourself in the demo environment.

## Creating an API Proxy

### Step 1: Log In

1. Go to [demo.apinizer.com](https://demo.apinizer.com/) and log in.
2. Select the Project created for you in the popup window that appears.

### Step 2: Go to API Proxy Creation Page

3. Select **Development → API Proxies** from the main menu on the left.
4. Click the **+Create** button in the upper right of the opened interface.

### Step 3: Load API Definition File

5. In the new API Proxy creation interface, click the **Enter URL** link for Swagger 2.x.
6. In the interface that appears, type the address `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` in the **URL** text box and click the **Parse** button on the right.
7. The Swagger file at the given address is parsed and the API's information is displayed.

### Step 4: Save the API Proxy

8. In the interface that appears, check the `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2` box in the **Address** section, write `/petstoreProxy` in the **Relative Path** field, and click the save button in the upper right.

<Info>
  The `petstoreProxy` address added as **Relative Path** is the virtual access point given for accessing the API through Apinizer.
</Info>

**That's how easy it is! The API Proxy creation is complete.**

## Deploying the API Proxy

When an API Proxy is created, several tabs appear in the interface. The behavior of the API Proxy is customized through configurations made from these tabs. The API Proxy must be deployed to be accessible.

### Step 1: Go to Develop Tab

1. Go to the **Develop** tab.
2. In the **Develop** tab, the API Proxy's endpoints appear on the left, policies and flow in the middle. Various links or buttons open interfaces related to configurations.

### Step 2: Start Deploy Process

3. The **Deploy** button is located in the upper middle. Click it. Active environment options (1 Prod in demo environment) appear, select the appropriate one. An optional deployment reason entry window appears, filling it is not mandatory. Continue by pressing the **Deploy** button.

**The API Proxy is deployed and ready for access.**

## Accessing the API Proxy

When the API Proxy is deployed, the access address appears in the interface. The API Proxy is now an API for clients (API Consumers) who want to access it and is accessible from this address.

There are many methods to send a request to an API. In this example, the interface provided by the platform will be used for simplicity.

### Step 1: Open Test Endpoint

1. Select the endpoint/method you want to access from the left. New links appear in the lower middle, and the access address is updated to show the address of the selected endpoint. Click the **Test Endpoint** link.

### Step 2: Send the Request

2. In the popup window that opens, which HTTP Method the endpoint expects, the access address, and below them, tabs for parameters (default), headers, body, validation rules, or advanced settings that can be managed for the endpoint are found.
3. Write `pending` in the value of the **status** parameter. You can see that the **URL** information changes along with the value you write here. Press the **Send** button.

### Step 3: Review the Response

4. Tabs containing the response returned by the endpoint, headers, validation results if a validation rule is defined, and detailed log records are visible.

**Congratulations! You have created and accessed an API Proxy.**
