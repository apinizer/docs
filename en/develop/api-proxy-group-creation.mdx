title: "API Proxy Group Creation"
description: "You can manage multiple API Proxies as a group, configure policies and settings at the group level. Policies are applied to requests coming through the group and forwarded to API Proxies in the group. You can configure group access with Client Route settings and provide OAuth2 authentication with group keys."
---

API Proxy Groups enable managing multiple API Proxies as a group. Policies added to the API Proxy Group and settings applied are executed when the request arrives at the API Proxy Group and forwarded to API Proxies in the group.

<Warning>
**Changes with 2024.05.1 Patch Version:**

- An API Proxy can be in multiple API Proxy Groups.
- The feature of managing API Proxies that need common policies with API Proxy Group has been removed.
- If you need to use common policies, you can use [Global Policies](/en/develop/global-configurations/global-policies) or [Policy Groups](/en/develop/global-configurations/policy-groups).
</Warning>

For more information, you can refer to the [API Proxy Group](/en/concepts/core-concepts/api-proxy-group) concept page.

## Formatting API Proxy Group

The formatting of the Overview (_Overview_), Settings (_Settings_), and Development (_Development_) tabs is exactly the same as those of API Proxy, except for a few small differences.

### Overview Tab (_Overview Tab_)

**The visual containing the Overview Tab is shown below:**

<img
  src="/images/develop/api-proxy-group-olusturma/genel-bakis-sekmesi.png"
  alt="Overview Tab"
  width="1000"
  height="410"
/>

The fields used for the Overview Tab configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name(_Name_) | The name of the API Proxy Group. Required field. |
| Description(_Description_) | Description/definition information related to the API Proxy Group. Optional. |
| Client Route | Routing information that clients will use to access the API Proxy Group. For detailed information, see: [Client Route Settings](/en/develop/api-proxy-creation/client-route-settings) |
| API Proxy Group Key(_API Proxy Group Key_) | Section where General and Secret Keys required for JWT or OAuth2 authorization through the API Proxy Group are managed. For detailed information, see how these keys are [managed for API Proxy](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/deployment-and-specification-information#api-proxy-key). |
| Deployment Information | Deployment status and environment information of the API Proxy Group. **Environment:**Environment where the API Proxy Group is deployed (Development, Test, Production). **URL:**Full URL address to be used to access the API Proxy Group. **Specs:**OpenAPI/Swagger specification information of the API Proxy Group. |

### API Proxy Group Key Section

Section where access keys of the API Proxy Group are managed. Access keys are used for OAuth2 Authentication Policy.

Client Id and Client Secret values are automatically generated, and the user can request new ones to be generated. If any of the keys are regenerated for a deployed API Proxy Group, the API Proxy Group must be redeployed for the keys to be valid.

### Accessing API Definition Files

The content of definition files opens as shown above when the **Show** link is clicked and can be copied from there. However, this method is for users with roles such as API Developer, API Tester working on the Apinizer platform. Clients cannot access these interfaces.

**Clients can use the access address of the Environment where the API Proxy Group is deployed as follows to access definition files:**

For example, let the access address of the API Proxy in the Production Environment be `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup`.

The following addresses can be used to send requests to access definition files;

**Swagger 2.x (JSON)**
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?swagger`
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?swagger&format=json`
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?swagger.json`

**Swagger 2.x (YAML)**
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?swagger&format=yaml`
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?swagger.yaml`

**OpenAPI 3.x (JSON)**
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?openapi`
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?openapi&format=json`
- `https://api.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup?openapi.json`

**OpenAPI 3.x (YAML)**

/>

**The visual containing the endpoint detail is shown below:**

<img
  src="/images/develop/api-proxy-group-olusturma/endpoint-detay.png"
  alt="Endpoint Detail"
  width="1000"
  height="250"
/>

In this screen, if the Type information of the request or the Model Content of the response is found, it can be clicked to view the detail.

Let the addresses to be used in the following examples be:

- Environment's access address: **`https://demo.apinizer.com/apigateway`**
- Gateway Address given for API Proxy Group: **`/apiProxyGroup1`**
- Address of API Proxy Group in the environment where it is deployed: **`https://demo.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup1`**
- Gateway Address given for API Proxy: **`/petstore`**
- Address of API Proxy in the environment where it is deployed: **`https://demo.apinizer.com/apigateway/petstore`**
- Endpoint to be accessed: **`/pet/findByStatus`**
- HTTP method value of the endpoint to be accessed: **GET**

<Warning>
Proxy Group only works on HTTP(S) protocol.
</Warning>

### Direct Access to API Proxy

There is no change in direct access to API Proxies added to the API Proxy Group. Clients continue to access API Proxies through the addresses created according to the Environments where they are deployed.

**Address where GET request will be sent:**

```
https://demo.apinizer.com/apigateway/petstore/pet/findByStatus?status=pending
```

### Accessing API Proxy Group

Methods/endpoints of API Proxies can be accessed through the address of the API Proxy Group.

#### Accessing an _endpoint_ of a REST type API Proxy

The access address to be used is found by adding the address of the method/_endpoint_ to be accessed to the gateway address specified for the API Proxy Group. **During this process, the API Proxy's own address is not considered.**

**Address where GET request will be sent:**

```
https://demo.apinizer.com/apigateway/apiProxyGroup1/pet/findByStatus?status=pending
```

If a method/endpoint is accessed through the API Proxy Group, the address of the **API Proxy** is not considered. The method/endpoint is treated as if it belongs directly to the API Proxy Group, and the URL for the method/endpoint is created with the address of the API Proxy Group.

<img
  src="/images/develop/api-proxy-group-olusturma/erisim-ornegi.png"
  alt="Access Example"
  width="1000"
  height="160"
/>

<Warning>
If there are multiple methods/endpoints with the same address and HTTP method among REST type API Proxies in the API Proxy Group, the request goes to the first found method/endpoint.

Some methods/endpoints belonging to other API Proxies in the group may become inaccessible due to a method/endpoint using path parameters belonging to any API Proxy in the API Proxy group.
</Warning>

#### Accessing a method/_endpoint_ of a SOAP type API Proxy

It is sufficient to send a request with the **SOAPAction** header of the method to be called and the relevant SOAP message to the access address of the API Proxy Group.

<Warning>
If there are multiple methods with the same method/SOAP Action among SOAP type API Proxies in the API Proxy Group, the request goes to the first found method.
</Warning>
