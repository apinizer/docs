## Request

### Creating Request Address

There are two ways to create a request address:

* The endpoint to be tested can be written manually
* An API Proxy on Apinizer can be tested from the **Test Helper** interface or a request address can be created from an API definition file

#### Creating Request Address with Test Helper

When the selected button in the following image is clicked, the Test Helper dialog opens.

<Frame caption="Test Helper Button">

<Frame caption="Test Helper Settings">
  <img src="/images/develop/test-debug-araclari/test-console/test-console-3.png" alt="Test Helper settings" width="600" height="500" />
</Frame>

The fields used for Test Helper configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Request Type** | The API type to be tested is determined by selecting one of Proxy, Proxy Group, Swagger, OpenApi, WADL, WSDL options. These types:<br/><br/>**Proxy, Proxy Group**<br/><br/>These types are selected when API Proxies in your selected project on Apinizer are desired to be tested.<br/><br/>Also, it is tested from the environments where the selected API Proxy is deployed.<br/><br/>**Swagger, OpenApi, WADL, WSDL**<br/><br/>These types are selected when testing is desired to be performed from an API definition file. |

<Info>
If the created endpoint has a parameter list and example request body, they are also created by Apinizer.

## Collection

Collection is the creation of test records configured under a group structure so that tests can be reused.

Multiple collections can be found within each collection.

### Saving Test to a Collection

After completing your test, click the **Save** button marked in the image to save it.

<Frame caption="Saving Test to Collection">
  <img src="/images/develop/test-debug-araclari/test-console/test-console-22.png" alt="Saving Test to Collection" width="600" height="400" />
</Frame>

Then, click the link of the collection to which the test will be assigned in the dialog named **Collection List** that opens.

Apinizer creates a collection named 'Default Collection' for startup.

After selecting your collection, the test is saved by giving it a name. The name of the default test record is determined as the endpoint URL information you tested.
