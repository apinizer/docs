## Shared Data Model Concept

Shared Data Model enables you to create reusable schema definitions in API Designer's spec first approach. By creating shared schema models that define data types in message content, you can use model inheritance and shared components with JSON Schema references. Created models can be imported and used within the Spec Design Editor.

## Creating Shared Data Model

A new Data Model can be created by clicking the **New (Create)** button in the upper right of the list interface.

<img src="/images/develop/data-models/data-model-1.png" alt="List interface" style={{maxWidth: '1000px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

The Shared Data Model creation settings are shown in the following image:

<img src="/images/develop/data-models/data-model-2.png" alt="Shared Data Model creation settings" style={{maxWidth: '1000px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

The fields used for shared data model creation configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The name information of the data model. |
| **Description** | Description related to the data model. |
| **Schema** <em>(Schema)</em> | Properties and fields to be included in the data and properties such as type, pattern, min-max are managed. |
| **Example** <em>(Example)</em> | An example of the data type can be created. |

## Adding Schema Property

You can define the structure of your data model by adding properties within the schema.

The Schema Property addition settings are shown in the following image:

<img src="/images/develop/data-models/data-model-3.png" alt="Schema Property addition settings" style={{maxWidth: '755px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

The fields used for Schema Property creation configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The name information of the schema. |
| **Description** | Description can be made about the schema. |
| **Type** | Field where the type of the schema is specified. |
| **Format** <em>(Format)</em> | A field that is active according to the selected type. There are formats that can be selected for some types:<br/><br/>**integer**<br/>- int32: Signed 32-bit integers (commonly used integer type).<br/>- int64: Signed 64-bit integers (long type).<br/><br/>**number**<br/>- float: Decimal numbers (6 digits).<br/>- double: Decimal numbers (14 digits).<br/><br/>**string**<br/>- byte: Base64 encoded characters. For example, **U3dhZ2dlciByb2Nrcw==**<br/>- binary: Binary data used to define files<br/>- date: Full date representation. For example, **2017-07-21**<br/>- date-time: Date-time representation. For example, **2017-07-21T17:32:28Z**<br/>- password: Used to mask input. |
| **$Ref Target** | If $ref is selected from the type field, this field becomes active.<br/><br/>A reference to another data model can be given. |
| **Property is** <em>(Property is)</em> | Specifies whether the model's usage is required. |
| **Behaviour** <em>(Behaviour)</em> | Determines the read-only/write-only information of the schema. |
| **Integer Properties** <em>(Integer Properties)</em> | If Integer is selected as type, these fields become active:<br/>- Minimum: To determine the smallest of the values that can be entered.<br/>- Maximum: To determine the largest of the values that can be entered.<br/>- MultipleOf: To determine this if the values to be entered are desired to be multiples of a number. |
| **String Properties** <em>(String Properties)</em> | If String is selected as type, these fields become active:<br/>- Pattern <em>(Pattern)</em>: Allows you to define a regular expression template for the string value. Only values matching this template will be accepted.<br/>- Min Length <em>(Min Length)</em>: To determine the minimum length of values that can be entered.<br/>- Max Length <em>(Max Length)</em>: To determine the maximum length of values that can be entered. |
| **Enum Values** <em>(Enum Values)</em> | If Enum is selected as type, this field becomes active.<br/><br/>Field where possible values of the model are entered. |
| **Example** <em>(Example)</em> | An example describing the schema can be given. |

   │
   │ Model Import
   │ $ref References
   │
   ▼
API Spec

<Info>
This integration between Shared Data Models and Spec Design Editor enables you to create consistent and centrally managed data structures with reusable schema definitions in spec first approach. Models are created once and can be used in multiple API Specs.
