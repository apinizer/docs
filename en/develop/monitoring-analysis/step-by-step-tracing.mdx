This tab is used to detect errors by monitoring the message traffic of the API Proxy. For this, the Step-by-Step Tracing mode must first be activated.

## Activating Step-by-Step Tracing Mode

For an API Proxy to be switched to tracing mode, this API Proxy must first be deployed to at least one Environment.

The Environment for which tracing mode will be opened is selected and the **Start** button is clicked.

Custom Query can be used from the filter field next to the environment selection to specifically trace only the desired data.

When Step-by-Step Tracing mode is activated, the content of log records stored for the API Proxy is expanded to allow detailed examination and continues to be stored in this way until the mode is stopped or automatically closed by the platform after 5 minutes.

The log records being displayed are not automatically updated so that the user does not lose any record they find. The **Refresh Logs** button is used for this.

**The visual containing example log records is shown below:**

Each of the log records shown in the table belongs to a request coming from a client to this API Proxy and the response message given to that request. The following operations can be performed on this message.

<Info>
Since the log record of the API Call Policy is kept separately, duplicate logs appear for the same request.

## Detailed View

The first one in the menu at the end of the row of the request message to be examined opens a window displaying the log records of that message.

In the window that opens, it is seen that logs are divided into sections related to message flow. When the name of the section to be examined (for example, the **Request From Client** section) is clicked, log records related to this area are displayed. By default, the **Overview** section is open.

## JSON View

The button next to the Detailed View button displays log records in JSON format.

**The visual containing the dialog opened when JSON View is clicked is shown below:**

## Download

It is also possible to download log records for more detailed examination. Apinizer creates detailed log records for all policies executed for the API Proxy while in step-by-step tracing mode. The download option provides the ability to download all log records created on a request basis in bulk.

## Quick Test

The Quick Test button on the relevant row opens the [Test Console](/en/develop/test-debug-tools/test-console) formatted so that the sent request can be tested immediately by resending it.

## Select

Click the **Select** button to view detailed log records related to policies executed for the API Proxy while Apinizer is in step-by-step tracing mode.

<img src="/images/develop/izleme-analiz/trace-select.png" alt="Select" width="600" style={{maxWidth: '600px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

When this button is clicked, a new section opens below the table containing log records. This section shows all policies executed for the selected message, including those coming from the API Proxy Group if any, in the order they were executed.

Small icons are located next to each policy and the Backend API indicating whether that step was executed successfully. Thus, if the message flow did not occur as expected, it is visible which policy caused the problem.

In the first image below, all policies are executed successfully, and in the second image, cases where the Authentication policy failed are exemplified.

Note that in the second image, the third policy that should be executed after the Authentication policy is not visible. Because with the failure of Authentication, the message flow was interrupted and an error response was returned to the client.

### Detailed Log Records

The section displayed with the selection of a log record provides a summary of whether the message flow was successful and, if it failed, at which point it occurred. However, the details that can be accessed are not limited to this.

In the image below, links that can be clicked to view detailed log records are numbered.

#### Client Log Records - Link Number 1

**Client** text is a link. When clicked, a window opens where details of messages sent from and returned to the client can be viewed.

In the first tab, details of the HTTP message sent by the client are visible.

<img src="/images/develop/izleme-analiz/trace-client-logs-1.png" alt="Client Log Records 1" width="800" style={{maxWidth: '800px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

In the second tab, details of the message sent from the client to the API Proxy are found.

In the third tab, there are details of the message returned from the API Proxy to the client.

#### Policy Log Records - Links in Areas Numbered 2 and 4

When a policy icon in area number 2 is clicked or the arrow next to the relevant policy in area number 4 is clicked, log records showing the message content coming to and going from that policy are opened.

<img src="/images/develop/izleme-analiz/trace-policy-logs.png" alt="Policy Log Records" width="800" style={{maxWidth: '800px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

#### Backend API Log Records - Link in Area Number 3

**API** text is a link. When clicked, a window opens where details of messages coming to and returned from the Backend API can be viewed.

In the first tab, details of the message coming from the API Proxy are visible.

<img src="/images/develop/izleme-analiz/trace-backend-logs-1.png" alt="Backend API Log Records 1" width="800" style={{maxWidth: '800px', width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

In the second tab, routing details made to the Backend API are visible (for routing options, you can refer to the [Routing Tab - HTTP (Routing Tab)](/en/develop/routing/http-routing) section).
