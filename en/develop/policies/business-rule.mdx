<Tip>
This document explains the detailed usage of a specific policy. If you are using Apinizer policies for the first time or want to learn the general working principles of policies, we recommend reading the [What is Policy?](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-policy) page first.
</Tip>

## Overview

### What is its Purpose?

- Transform data on request or response according to business rules with action chains to make it consistent.
- Normalize content coming from different data sources to ensure integrity in API Proxy flow.
- Apply business logic only in specific endpoint flows with conditional rule execution.
- Keep sensitive fields that need to be masked or removed under control at policy level.

### Working Principle

1. **Request Arrival**: For each HTTP/HTTPS request arriving at the API Gateway, the source IP address of the request is identified.
2. **Policy Check**: If the Business Rule policy is active, the system checks in the following order:
   - Is a Condition defined? If so, is the condition met?
   - Is the policy active (active=true)?
   - Is a Variable being used or is Apinizer default?
3. **Action Chain Execution**: Action list is evaluated sequentially; each action applies operators according to selected data type (numeric/string/temporal), extracts JWT claims if needed, or performs JSON/XML transformation.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - **Match Found**: All actions are applied; request's payload, header, or variables are updated.
   - **No Match**: Policy is skipped; request continues in flow with current state.
5. **Error Handling**: Customizable HTTP status code and error message are returned for requests that do not comply with the policy rule.

## Features and Capabilities

### Basic Features

- **Action Chain Management**: Sequential operations are defined on variables in the request with action types like Add, Modify, Delete, Stop.
- **Data Type-Based Operator Support**: Different operators (e.g., Substring, Add Temporal, Multiply) can be selected for Numeric, String, and Temporal data types.
- **Advanced Transformation Capability**: JSON↔XML transformations, XSLT/JOLT-based manipulations, and URL encode/decode operations are performed within action scope.
- **Active/Passive Status Control**: Easily change the active or passive status of the policy (active/passive toggle). In passive mode, the policy is not applied but its configuration is preserved.
- **Condition-Based Application**: Determine when the policy will be applied by creating complex conditions with Query Builder (e.g., only for specific endpoints or header values).

### Advanced Features

- **JWT Claim Extraction**: JWT contents can be retrieved to variables with Extract JWT Header Claim and Extract JWT Body Claim operators.
- **Variable Management Integration**: Project variables can be selected as source and target, updated from dialog screen if needed.
- **Transformation Profile Settings**: Null, empty, and array behaviors in JSON to XML / XML to JSON transformations are managed with fine-tuning.
- **Export/Import Feature**: Export policy configuration as a ZIP file. Import to different environments (Development, Test, Production). Version control and backup capability.
- **Policy Group and Proxy Group Support**: Manage multiple policies within Policy Group. Bulk policy assignment to Proxy Groups. Centralized update and deploy operations.
- **Deploy and Versioning**: Deploy policy changes to live environment. See which API Proxies use it (Policy Usage). Proxy Group and Policy Group usage reports.

## Usage Scenarios

| Scenario | Status | Solution (Policy Application) | Expected Behavior / Result |
|----------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| JWT Claim Enrichment | User role needs to be moved to header after authentication. | Action List: Source data type String, operator Extract JWT Body Claim, target variable X-User-Role. | Role value is added to header, backend does not make additional query. |
| Credit Card Masking | Full card number is falling into logs. | Action List: operator Mask, maskFrom=6, maskTo=12. | Card number is masked, sensitive data is protected. |
| Date Normalization | There are endpoints receiving dates in different formats. | Action List: Source data type Temporal, operator Add Temporal (0 days), format=yyyy-MM-dd. | All dates are converted to standard format. |
| XML → JSON Transformation | Legacy service returns XML, microservice expects JSON. | Action List: operator Transform, transformation type XML to JSON, unwrapElement=true. | Response is rewritten in JSON format |
| Value Validation and Stop | Request should not continue with incorrect value. | First action: condition check, second action: action type Stop, custom error message. | Flow stops on rule violation and custom error is returned. |
| Multiple Variable Merging | Data from different headers will be collected and new payload field will be created. | Action List: operator Concat collects source header values, target value source Variable. | New field is created, downstream service does not perform complex operation. |

## Configuring Policy Parameters

In this section, you can create a new **Business Rule** policy or configure existing policy parameters to define access rules.

### Creating a New Business Rule Policy

<img src="/images/develop/politikalar/is-kurali-policy-definitions.png" alt="Policy Definitions and Actions menu (Add, Modify, Delete, Stop)" width="1000" />

In the **Policy Definitions** section, use the **Actions** dropdown to add a new action or choose its type. The following action types are available:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Add** | Adds a new variable or value to the request/response. Injection Target (target variable) is required. |
| **Modify** | Updates the value of an existing variable or field (masking, transformation, JWT claim extraction, etc.). |
| **Delete** | Removes the specified variable or field from the message. |
| **Stop** | Stops the flow and returns a custom error message. |

Depending on the selected action type, the **Action Definition - Add** or **Action Definition - Modify** modal opens, where you define Injection Target and Conditions.

#### Configuration Steps

| Step | Description / Operation |
|------|----------------------|
| **Step 1: Go to Creation Page** | - Go to **Development → Global Settings → Global Policies → Business Rule** from the left menu.<br />- Click the **[+ Create]** button at the top right. |
| **Step 2: Enter Basic Information** | **Policy Status:** Shows Active/Passive status. New policies are active by default.<br /><br />**Name (Required):**<br />Example: `Production_BusinessRule`<br />- Enter a unique name, does not start with space.<br />- System automatically checks: Green checkmark: available Red X: existing name.<br /><br />**Description:**<br />Example: "Transforms variables in request flow according to business rules in Prod environment."<br />- Max. 1000 characters.<br />- Explain the purpose of the policy. |
| **Step 3: Define Action Chain** | - In **Policy Definitions**, open the **Actions** dropdown and select **Add**, **Modify**, **Delete**, or **Stop**.<br />- In the dialog that opens, set Action Type, Source Data Type (Numeric/String/Temporal), and operator (e.g., Substring, Add Temporal, Extract JWT Body Claim) and fill their parameters. |
| **Step 4: Source and Target Selection (If Any)** | - Enter **Source Variable** or literal value for source value.<br />- Use **Target Variable** or **Target Value** in target.<br />- Open Variable dialogs to create and bind project variables. Variable type selection and creation flow when adding Business Rule action types have been improved for a clearer user experience. |
| **Step 5: Define Condition (Optional)** | - Go to **Condition** tab.<br />- Conditions determine when the policy will be active.<br /><br />**Examples:**<br />- Environment-based: `Header = X-Environment, Operator = Equals, Value = production`<br />- API Key-based: `Header = X-API-Key, Starts With = PROD-`<br />- Endpoint-based: `Path = /api/admin/*`<br />If no condition is defined, policy is always active<br /><br />For details, you can refer to: [Conditions](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-policy#conditions) |
| **Step 6: Customize Error Message (Optional)** | - Go to **Error Message Customization** tab.<br />- Customize the message to be returned when access is denied or on Stop action.<br />- Use **template-based (dynamic) error messages** with placeholders such as `#{error.errorCode}`, `#{request.uri}`, `#{dateTime.formattedText}`, `#{message.correlationId}` to include request and error details in the message. See [What is Policy? – Template-Based Error Messages](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-policy#template-based-dynamic-error-messages) for details.<br /><br />**Default:**<br />`{ "statusCode": 403, "message": "[Default error message]" }`<br /><br />**Custom (template example):**<br />`Error Code: #{error.errorCode}, Time: #{dateTime.formattedText}, Request ID: #{message.correlationId}` |
| **Step 7: Save** | - Click the **[Save]** button at the top right.<br /><br />**Checklist:**<br />- Unique name<br />- Required fields filled<br />- At least one action exists<br /><br />**Result:**<br />- Policy is added to the list.<br />- Can be connected to APIs.<br />- If global policy, automatically applied. |

## Best Practices

### Things to Do and Best Practices

| Category | Description / Recommendations |
|----------|----------------------------|
| **Action Chain Design** | **Bad:** Combining all business rules in a single action.<br />**Good:** Defining each rule as a separate action.<br />**Best:** Ordering logically grouped actions and dividing with Stop action if needed. |
| **Variable Management** | **Bad:** Working with literal values and not using variables.<br />**Good:** Reading common values from project variables.<br />**Best:** Creating versioned variables with variable dialog and standardizing targets. |
| **Error Message Structure** | **Bad:** Leaving general error message.<br />**Good:** Writing a directive message to user.<br />**Best:** Customizing error message with code, message, and debug-friendly context. |
| **Condition Management** | **Bad:** Leaving conditions empty and running policy on every request.<br />**Good:** Filtering based on endpoint or header.<br />**Best:** Using Query Builder by combining environment, user segment, and method information. |
| **Cross-Environment Transfer** | **Bad:** Directly editing in Production environment.<br />**Good:** Editing and exporting in test environment.<br />**Best:** Performing version control with ZIP export-import and deploying changes through pipeline. |

### Security Best Practices

| Security Area | Description / Warnings |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **JWT Claim Management** | Only retrieve needed fields when extracting claims, mask unauthorized information. |
| **Data Masking** | Shorten personal data with Mask or Substring, prevent sensitive data from falling into logs. |
| **Error Message Control** | Do not put internal system details in error messages in production. Write general but directive messages. |
| **Global Policy Updates** | Review usage list before updating global policy, localize if needed. |
| **Variable Authorization** | Select only variables accessed by authorized users as target variable, check permissions. |

### Things to Avoid

| Category | Description / Warnings |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Empty Action List** | **Why to avoid:** No operation is performed even if policy is saved, expected workflow is broken.<br />**Alternative:** Define at least one action and check validation icon. |
| **Wrong Data Type Selection** | **Why to avoid:** Operator gives error or unexpected result occurs.<br />**Alternative:** Analyze source data, correctly select Numeric/String/Temporal type. |
| **Uncontrolled Stop Usage** | **Why to avoid:** All requests may be accidentally stopped, service interruption occurs.<br />**Alternative:** Apply Stop action only after condition filter. |
| **Directly Deleting Global Policy** | **Why to avoid:** Multiple APIs may become unprotected.<br />**Alternative:** First deactivate or replace with local policy then delete. |

### Performance Tips

| Criterion | Recommendation / Impact |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Action Order** | **Recommendation:** Put frequently used and light actions at the beginning.<br />**Impact:** Flow can be terminated before unnecessary heavy operations. |
| **Transformation Operators** | **Recommendation:** Use Transform operations minimally, open separate policy if needed.<br />**Impact:** CPU load decreases, latency drops. |
| **Condition Filters** | **Recommendation:** Write narrow-scope conditions with Query Builder.<br />**Impact:** Policy works only when needed, throughput increases. |
| **Variable Sharing** | **Recommendation:** Take frequently used values to project variables.<br />**Impact:** Literal operations are not performed repeatedly within action. |
| **JWT Operations** | **Recommendation:** Limit JWT claim extraction to only requests that need it.<br />**Impact:** Unnecessary parsing cost decreases. |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

| Category | Question | Answer |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **General** | What types of data does this policy work on? | Works with Numeric, String, and Temporal data types; operator selection is automatically filtered according to data type. |
| **General** | Should I create global or local? | Global is recommended if multiple API Proxies need the same rule, local if specific to a single API. |
| **Technical** | What does Stop action do? | Action chain stops at this point, customized error message is returned and flow ends. |
| **Technical** | How is target value set when extracting JWT claim? | Operator automatically makes target value source Variable; you need to select a project variable. |
| **Usage** | Why am I getting a warning if Action List is empty? | At least one action is required for policy to work; warning icon indicates this. |
| **Usage** | How do I control array fields in XML to JSON transformation? | Enter XPaths that should be arrays in `xmlToJsonArrayPathList` field to get correct type in transformation. |
