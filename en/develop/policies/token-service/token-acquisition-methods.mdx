---

There are two types of methods for acquiring tokens. These methods are activated by selecting one of the "Manage From This Policy" or "Manage From ACL" options through the created JWT/OAuth2 Policy. Token acquisition operations will be explained in detail for both methods.

## 1. Token Acquisition with "Manage From This Policy" Option

<Info>
The ways to obtain **client_id** and **client_secret** values according to the management level of the Authentication policy are as follows:

* **If Authentication Policy is Added to API Proxy:** client_id and client_secret values are obtained from the "Show Proxy Key" section in the Overview section of the API Proxy.
* **If Authentication Policy is Added to Proxy Group:** client_id and client_secret values are obtained from the "Show Proxy Key" section in the Overview section of the API Proxy Group.
* **If Authentication Policy is Added to Policy Group:** client_id and client_secret values are obtained from the "Show Proxy Key" section in the Definition section of the relevant Policy Group.
</Info>

### 1.1 Token Acquisition with JWT

If the "Manage From This Policy" option is selected in the created JWT Policy, tokens are acquired using this method.

Prepare a new HTTP request using Apinizer Test Console or another application of your choice.

* The address should be entered similar to the following according to your own Apinizer access address: `https://apinizerErisimAdresiniz/auth/jwt`.

<Info>
If the **Allow URL Parameters** option is selected, information can be sent using GET method and URL parameters. (See the table below for parameters to be sent)
</Info>

* HTTP Method should be POST.
* "x-www-form-urlencoded" value should be selected in the Body field. If Apinizer Test Console is not used, a header should be added with "Content-Type" name and "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" value.
* The values to be entered in the Body field are as shown in the table below.

| Key Name | Value to Enter if "client_credentials" is Selected When Defining Policy | Value to Enter if "password" is Selected When Defining Policy |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| grant_type | client_credentials | password |
| client_id | Public Key value obtained from API Key field | Public Key value obtained from API Key field |
| client_secret | Secret Key value obtained from API Key field | "-" (dash) |
| username | This field is not added | Username of one of the records in the authentication pool you selected |
| password | This field is not added | Password of one of the records in the authentication pool you selected |

#### Token Refresh

If the **Token Should Be Immortal** option is closed and the **Token Refresh Should Be** option is opened, *tokens* that will become invalid after a certain period can be refreshed within the period specified in the **Refreshed Token Validity Period** field.

Prepare a new HTTP request using Apinizer Test Console or another application of your choice.

* The address should be entered similar to the following according to your own Apinizer access address: `https://apinizerErisimAdresiniz/auth/jwt`.

<Info>
If the **Allow URL Parameters** option is selected, information can be sent using GET method through URL parameters. (See the table below for parameters to be sent).
</Info>

* HTTP Method should be POST.
* "x-www-form-urlencoded" value should be selected in the Body field. If Apinizer Test Console is not used, a header should be added with "Content-Type" name and "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" value.
* The values to be entered in the Body field are as shown in the table below.

| Key Name | Key Value |
|----------|-----------|
| grant_type | refresh_token |
| client_id | Public Key value obtained from API Key field |
| client_secret | "-" (dash) |
