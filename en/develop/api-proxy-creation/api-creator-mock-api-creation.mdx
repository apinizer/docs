### Mock API Definition Fields

Fields used for Mock API definition are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Type** | Mock API Creation type. Done by Blank and uploading Spec file. |
| **Name** | The name given to the API by the user. This name appears in interfaces. |
| **Description** | Definition information of the API. |
| **Generate CRUD Operations** | Selected if ready method/endpoints of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE types are desired to be created for Mock API. |

| **Import Type** | Type information of the Spec file to be uploaded. Supported types: URL, Upload File |
| **URL** | Address of the Spec file to be uploaded. |

## Endpoint Creation

<Info>
  If the *Generate CRUD Operations* option is selected, method/endpoints of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE types will come ready by default.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Endpoint">
    A new method/endpoint is added by clicking the **Add** button.

      <img
          src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock4.png"
          alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
          width="400"
          className="mr-auto"
      />   </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill Endpoint Information">
    Method/endpoint is added to the API by clicking the **Add** button on the screen that appears. Fields in the *Method/Endpoint* definition screen are filled and the **Save** button is clicked.

      <img
          src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock5.png"
          alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
          width="1000"
          className="mr-auto"
      />   </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding or Editing Response

Responses belonging to method/endpoint are managed from the Response Information section.

<Info>
  Response definitions are created grouped according to Status Code information. Multiple example responses based on conditions can be created within each response definition.
</Info>

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock6.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
Fields used for response add/edit configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Status Code** | HTTP status code information. |
| **Description** | Definition information of Method/Endpoint. |
| **Headers** | HTTP Headers information is entered. |
| **Response Examples** | Response examples to be sent to the user. |

### Adding or Editing Response Examples

Examples can be added by creating multiple body and condition definitions for a response definition. Thus, when a request comes to the same method, different responses can be sent to the client under different conditions.

    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
Fields used for Example Response add/edit configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Content Type** | Content type of the body that will be returned as a response. |
| **Condition** | Used to define under which condition the defined example response will be returned. |
| **Response Body** | The body of the response to be returned to the user is written. |

## Creating API Proxy from Mock API

When there is at least one method/endpoint, an API Proxy is created for Mock API by clicking the **Create API Proxy** button.

<Info>
At least one method/endpoint must exist to create an API Proxy from Mock API.
</Info>

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock8.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="1000"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
The API Proxy is created by entering the required fields for the API Proxy on the screen that appears and clicking the **Save** button.

After this step, what can be done is exactly the same as the API Proxy document. You can refer to the [API Proxy Creation](/en/develop/api-proxy-creation/api-proxy-creation) page for details.

## Deploy/Redeploy

The window opened by clicking the **Manage API Proxies** link is used to view and manage deployment statuses of API Proxies in Mock API.

In the opened window, Deploy/Undeploy and Redeploy operations for API Proxies created with Mock API are performed in this section. You can refer to the [Deployment, Redeployment, Undeployment, Deployment History and Rollback](/en/develop/deployment-and-version-management) page for details.

To deploy the API Proxy, the following steps are followed.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock9.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
After the above operation, confirmation is required. Information about the deployment operation is created and the **(Deploy) Deploy** button is clicked.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock10.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
<Warning>
When a new endpoint is added to Mock API or changes are made within an endpoint, all API Proxies created from this API must be redeployed for the changes to take effect.
</Warning>

When you add a new Method/Endpoint or update an existing Method/Endpoint, a notification like the following will appear.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock11.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
By saying **Redeploy**, changes are applied to API Proxies.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock12.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
After the above operation, confirmation is required. Information about the redeployment operation is created and the **(Redeploy) Redeploy** button is clicked.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock13.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
From the Mock API page, go to the API Proxy by clicking the API Proxy's name.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock14.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
Similarly, to go to the Mock API page from the API Proxy page, go by clicking the Mock API name in the API Proxy as shown below.

<img
    src="/images/develop/api-proxy-olusturma/mock15.png"
    alt="Image 2024 9 9 15 35 35 Pn"
    width="600"
    className="mr-auto"
/>
## Mock API Deletion

When a Mock API is deleted, all API Proxies connected to it are first removed (undeploy) and then deleted.
