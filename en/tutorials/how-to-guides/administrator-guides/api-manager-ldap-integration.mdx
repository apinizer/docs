This document explains how to add LDAPs login credentials in Apinizer and how to log in to Apinizer with your LDAP users as an example.

## 1) Adding LDAPs Connection Information

Open the **Connection Management → LDAP/Active Directory** page and add your information.

In the **Server Address** field, start with **ldaps://** followed by the **ldap domain** and then add port **636**.

An example image containing LDAPs connection settings is shown below:

    width="1000"
    height="462"
  />


Check the **Use SSL** button for SSL usage.

If **Certificate Required** is selected in the **Certificate Status** field, see [this address](/en/admin/secrets-management/certificates) to add a certificate.

You can also add a restriction to the search using the **Custom Filter** field.

For example, the filter **(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(mail=example@example.com))** will work for users belonging to the **"inetOrgPerson"** class with email address **"example@example.com"**.

In LDAP, users and groups are usually stored under different organizational units.

Therefore, different **base DN** addresses can be given for users and groups:

- Base DN for users: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
- Base DN for groups: `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`

After entering your LDAP information, select one from the **Environment** field on the same page and click the **Test Connection** button. When the operation is successful, you will see an output like in the example image below.

    alt="Test Connection Successful"
    width="400"
  />

You can complete adding LDAPs information to your system by clicking the **Save and Deploy** button.

## 2) LDAPs Login Settings

This section contains LDAP connection configurations that will enable integration with identity management systems available in organizations and accessible via LDAP connection so that users can log in to Apinizer.

Open the **Administration → System Settings → LDAP Settings** page.

  <img

    alt="LDAP Settings Page"
    width="1000"
    height="471"
  />

Give a name to the connection as shown in the image above and select the LDAP connection you added in the previous step from the **LDAP Connection** section. Click the edit button marked with red areas and enter the relevant information.

An example usage for the **User Object Class Definition** popup page is shown in the image below:

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/04-user-object-class-definition.png"
    alt="User Object Class Definition"
    width="1000"
    height="565"
  />

You can view how the relevant fields for **User** in the example image above can be filled by connecting to your existing LDAP application.

One of the points to note is that the **object class** value is written in the **User Object Class Name** field.

In other fields specified as **Attribute**, only the **attribute** expression is written.

For this example, you can connect using the JXplorer application and examine its usage from the image below.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/05-jxplorer-example.png"
    alt="JXplorer User Example"
    width="400"
  />

According to the example image above, you can see that the Object Class Name for the user is **inetOrgPerson**. This information may vary according to your relevant **LDAP** application.

An example usage for the **Group Object Class Definition** popup page is shown in the image below:

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/06-group-object-class-definition.png"
    alt="Group Object Class Definition"
    width="1000"
    height="550"
  />

You can view how the relevant fields for **Group** in the example image above can be filled by connecting to your existing LDAP application.

One of the points to note is that the **object class** value is written in the **Group Object Class Name** field.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/07-jxplorer-group-example.png"
    alt="JXplorer Group Example"
    width="800"
  />

After entering the information, click the **Test Configuration** button located in the upper right corner as shown in the image below.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/08-test-configuration.png"
    alt="Test Configuration"
    width="800"
  />

When a test login is performed on the opened page with the **LDAP user** whose **uid** value is **member2** as specified in the example image above and their password, it will return a **Success** response.

Test with your user information in your LDAP application.

After seeing the successful response, save the information by clicking the **Save** button.

## 3) Authorizing LDAP Users or Group Members in Project

This section explains authorization operations for LDAP users and groups on a project basis.

Select a project from the area where your projects are located as shown in the image below.

  <img

    alt="Project Selection"
    width="600"
  />

After selecting a project, to give user permission to your project:

Open the **Project Settings → Members** page.

Write your LDAP user in the **LDAP User Members** field as shown in the image below and click the **Search in LDAP** button.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/10-ldap-user-members.png"
    alt="LDAP User Members"
    width="1000"
    height="486"
  />

Your LDAP user will appear on the screen as shown in the image below. You can select a permission in the **Choose** field and add it with **Add**.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/11-add-user-permission.png"
    alt="Add User Permission"
    width="1000"
    height="216"
  />

You can add **permissions for group members** in the area shown in the image below.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/nasil-yapilir-kilavuzlari/yonetici-kilavuzlari/api-manager-ldap-entegrasyonu/12-group-members-permissions.png"
    alt="Group Members Permissions"
    width="1000"
    height="210"
  />

After completing the authorization operations, you can complete the save operation by clicking the **Save Changes** button located in the upper right corner of the page.

After this stage, the relevant users or groups will have the permissions you specified in your project.
