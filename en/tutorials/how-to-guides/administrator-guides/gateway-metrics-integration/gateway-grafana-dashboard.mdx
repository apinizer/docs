## Dashboard Panels

The panel examples below are configurations you can use in Grafana to visualize Apinizer Gateway metrics.

### Panel 1: Total API Request Volume by Request Type

<Card title="Timeseries Visualization" icon="chart-line">
  Shows total, successful, and failed API requests as a time series.
</Card>

**PromQL Queries:**

- **A (Total Requests):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_total_count_total[5m]))`
- **B (Successful Requests):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_success_count_total[5m]))`
- **C (Failed Requests):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_error_count_total[5m]))`

**Visualization Type:** Timeseries

**Panel Settings:**
- Use different colors for each query (e.g., Total=blue, Successful=green, Failed=red)
- Enable legend
- Use "req/s" as Y-axis unit

### Panel 2: APIs with Highest Traffic Volume

<Card title="Bar Chart Visualization" icon="chart-bar">
  Shows the top 5 APIs with the highest traffic volume in the last 100 minutes.
</Card>

**PromQL Query:**

```promql
topk(5, sum by (api_name) (increase(apinizer_api_traffic_total_count_tagged_total[100m])))
```

**Visualization Type:** Bar gauge or Bar chart

**Panel Settings:**
- Direction: Horizontal
- Sorting: High to low
- Enable legend and show API names

### Panel 3: API Processing Time Details

<Card title="Timeseries Visualization" icon="clock">
  Shows request pipeline, routing, and response pipeline times separately.
</Card>

**PromQL Queries:**

- **A (Request Pipeline Time):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_request_pipeline_time_seconds_sum[5m])) / sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_request_pipeline_time_seconds_count[5m])) * 1000`
- **B (Routing Time):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_routing_time_seconds_sum[5m])) / sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_routing_time_seconds_count[5m])) * 1000`
- **C (Response Pipeline Time):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_response_pipeline_time_seconds_sum[5m])) / sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_response_pipeline_time_seconds_count[5m])) * 1000`

**Visualization Type:** Timeseries

**Panel Settings:**
- Use "ms" (milliseconds) as Y-axis unit
- Use different colors and styles for each query
- Enable legend

### Panel 4: Average Request / Response Size

<Card title="Timeseries Visualization" icon="database">
  Shows average sizes of request and response messages.
</Card>

**PromQL Queries:**

- **A (Average Request Size):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_request_size_bytes_sum[5m])) / sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_request_size_bytes_count[5m]))`
- **B (Average Response Size):** `sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_response_size_bytes_sum[5m])) / sum(rate(apinizer_api_traffic_response_size_bytes_count[5m]))`

**Visualization Type:** Timeseries

**Panel Settings:**
- Use "bytes" or "decbytes" as Y-axis unit
- Use different colors for each query
- Enable legend

### Panel 5: CPU Usage of Pods

<Card title="Gauge Visualization" icon="microchip">
  Shows CPU usage percentage of each Gateway pod.
</Card>

**PromQL Query:**

```promql
sum(system_cpu_usage{pod=~".*"}) by (pod) * 100
```

**Visualization Type:** Gauge

**Panel Settings:**
- Set thresholds (e.g., Green: 0-70%, Yellow: 70-90%, Red: 90-100%)
- Min: 0, Max: 100
- Use "%" as Y-axis unit
- Show pod names in legend

## Dashboard Creation Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Panel Layout" icon="th">
    Organize panels in logical groups. API traffic metrics can be at the top, system metrics at the bottom.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Color Scheme" icon="palette">
    Use a consistent color scheme. Use green for successful operations, red for errors, yellow for warnings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Range" icon="clock">
    Set the default time range for the dashboard. Usually the last 1 hour or last 24 hours is useful.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refresh Interval" icon="sync">
    Set the automatic refresh time of the dashboard. 30 seconds is suitable for high-traffic systems, 1-5 minutes for low-traffic systems.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  These panel examples are sufficient to create a basic dashboard. You can add additional panels or customize existing panels according to your needs.
