This document will explain step by step how to access the API Portal menu and how you can define **API Proxies** and **API Proxy Groups** that will be displayed in the **API Portal** as **API Products**.

## Accessing Portal Menu and API Product Definition Screen

With **Apinizer API Portal**, you can showcase **APIs/Web Services** from a central location and make them available to **API** users, and manage API consumption of users according to their plans with **quota** or **throttling** policies specific to your plan definitions.

To publish an **API Proxy** through the API Portal, an **API Product** definition must be made.

Access to the Portal menu is only through **admin** menus and with appropriate permissions.

    alt="Portal Menu"
    width="800"
  />


By entering the "**API Products**" menu within the "**Portal**" menu and clicking the **Create** button in the top right, the entry of necessary information for new **API Product** definition is made.

<Warning>
We recommend that the **API Proxy** / **API Proxy Group** you select here be protected by a security policy, and that **API Proxy** / **Proxy Group** without a security policy not be opened for Portal use for security reasons.
</Warning>

<Note>
We recommend that you do not directly publish the **API Proxy** / **API Proxy Group** you actively use here, but publish a replica of the relevant **API Proxy** / **API Proxy Group** in a different project on the API Portal.
This way, you can isolate the traffic coming to this API product from the other and create a more controlled environment.
</Note>

Before starting **API Product** definition, it is necessary to see their usage by making **Category** and **Responsible Unit** definitions that facilitate managing **API Products** with defined **API Product**:

## Responsible Unit / Category Definition

From the "**Definitions**" tab under Portal in the left menu, you can make new **Responsible Units** and **Category** definitions from the "**Responsible Units**" and "**Categories**" menus, and view and edit existing Responsible Units and Categories.

    alt="Definitions Menu"
    width="200"
  />

### Responsible Unit Definition

By entering the **Responsible Unit** page from the **Definitions** section under the **Portal** menu, you can view, update your existing **Responsible Units**, or add a new one.

**Responsible Unit** represents the unit responsible for **API Products**.
To define a new **Responsible Unit** or view and edit existing ones, click **Responsible Unit** from the **Definitions** menu under the **Portal** tab.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image3.png"
    alt="Responsible Unit Menu"
    width="200"
  />

On the opened page, you can view, update **Responsible Units**, and create a new one.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image4.png"
    alt="Responsible Unit List"
    width="800"
  />

To create a new **Responsible Unit**, the **Create** button in the top right is triggered.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image5.png"
    alt="Creating Responsible Unit"
    width="800"
  />

After the **Save** button is triggered, a new **Responsible Unit** definition is made by filling in the fields on the opened page.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image6.png"
    alt="Responsible Unit Form"
    width="800"
  />

<Note>
**Parent Unit** shows a reference to the unit to which the relevant **Responsible Unit** is connected. We recommend that **Responsible Unit** definition be made by establishing a sub-unit - parent unit relationship here. You can manage by displaying parent units next to relevant unit definitions on the listing screen.
</Note>

### Category Definition

**Category** definition enables advanced search by filtering by category when searching through the **API Portal** by including **API Products** in categories.

To make a new **Category** definition, we need to go to the **Categories** page from the **Definitions** tab within the **Portal** menu.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image7.png"
    alt="Categories Menu"
    width="200"
  />

Within the **Categories** page, you can view, update previously defined **Categories**, or add a new one.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image8.png"
    alt="Categories List"
    width="800"
  />

A new **Category** definition can be made by triggering the Create button.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image9.png"
    alt="Creating Category"
    width="800"
  />

The **save** button is triggered by entering the name of the **Category** to be defined.

  <img

    alt="Category Form"
    width="800"

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image11.png"
    alt="Category Saved"
    width="800"
  />

We will display the **Category** we just added in the listing screen within the **Categories** page.

## API Product Definition and Publishing the Defined API Product on API Portal

We can make **API Product** definition by filling in the necessary fields from the screen shown in the images below.

<Note>
You can examine the fields related to **API Product** definition in more detail from the **[API Products](/en/api-portal/api-product)** page.
</Note>

Example definitions are shown in the screenshots below.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image13.png"
    alt="API Product Form - 1"
    width="800"
  />

    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image15.png"
    alt="API Product Form - 3"
    width="800"
  />

The **Visibility** and **Plan & Monetization** fields are very important for API Product definition.

<Note>
You can examine the **[API Products](/en/api-portal/api-product)** page to learn more about the relevant fields.
</Note>

**Public:** API Product can be viewed by everyone who is / is not a member of the API Portal.

**Only Logged In Organizations:** Only organizations that have logged in can see the API Product.

**Authorized Organizations:** Organizations authorized for the API Product can view it.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image16.png"
    alt="Visibility Options"
    width="600"
  />

**Free**: Enables consumption of **API Product** free of charge

**Subscription**: Works on a monthly or annual subscription system. Additional charges or suspension operations can be performed in case of consumption overrun.

**Metered**: Per-request pricing is applied.

**Tiered**: A tiered payment plan is created.

  <img

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image18.png"
    alt="Plan Configuration"
    width="800"
  />

<Note>
**quota** or **throttling** can be applied regardless of which plan is selected according to need.
</Note>

In the plan selection step, the request flow of the **API Product** can be limited by activating the **Enable Throttling** or **Enable Quota** options.

In the image below, **Free** plan selection has been made and **Throttling** application has been performed with a limit of 50 requests per minute.

    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image19.png"
    alt="Free Plan Throttling"
    width="800"

**API Product** definition is completed by pressing the **Save** button.

  <img

    alt="API Product Saved"
    width="800"

After **API Product** definition, to publish the **API Product** on the **API Portal** side, it is necessary to trigger the "**unpublished**" button in the top right corner and publish it through the opened popup.

  <img
    src="/images/tutorials/api-portal-senaryolari/api-portal-manager-islemleri/image21.png"

    alt="Publishing Confirmation"
    width="800"
  />

After completing the above steps, we will be able to view the published API Product in the API Products listing screen with a published status.
