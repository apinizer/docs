## Monitoring Modules

Apinizer Monitoring modules are used to monitor the general health status of the system, detect anomalies, and trigger actions when specified threshold values are exceeded.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Health Check" icon="heart-pulse" href="/en/monitor/api-health-check">
    Automatically checks whether APIs and web services are continuously running
  </Card>
  <Card title="Anomaly Detector" icon="shield-check" href="/en/monitor/anomaly-detector">
    Automatically detects abnormal behaviors in API traffic

    Sends notifications when specified threshold values are exceeded
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Health Check

The [API Health Check](/en/monitor/api-health-check) module enables monitoring the uptime status of the Proxy within the specified time interval using the Uptime Monitor. Actions can be triggered when expectations are not met.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Features">
    - **Basic Purpose**: Monitor uptime status and trigger actions
    - **Configuration**: Monitor Name, Description, Active status, and execution frequency (Trigger Every) are determined
    - **Request Information**: Method type and URL of the URL to be tested are entered
    - **Assertions**: Used to validate monitor results
    - **Action**: Selection of the action to be performed when the monitor is executed is provided
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assertions">
    Used to validate monitor results:
    - **Result Status Code**: Default 200
    - **Result Body**: Response body check
    - **XPath Result**: XML response check
    - **JsonPath Result**: JSON response check
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Anomaly Detector

The [Anomaly Detector](/en/monitor/anomaly-detector) is a technique that enables finding unexpected situations or patterns by analyzing time-based data in log records. In the literature, these unexpected situations are called outliers or exceptions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Features">
    - **Definition**: Detection of situations (anomalies) that do not conform to expected behaviors of data (e.g., unexpected spending increase)
    - **Data Sources**: Query created/selected to analyze log records and Filter information to be added to it are required
    - **Conditions**: Multiple conditions can be used to determine an anomaly, and these are connected with the 'and' operator
    - **Action**: Selection of the action to be performed when an anomaly is detected is provided
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metric Measurement Types">
    There are four different types of metric measurements:

    1. **Metric Value Check**: Situations such as whether the average value of the metric is above/below a threshold are checked
    2. **Metric Increase/Decrease Rate Check**: Comparison of the metric's behavior (e.g., increase rate) relative to the previous value is specified
    3. **EMA with Bollinger Bands Usage**: EMA formula is applied on the selected metric value, and it is checked whether the result is above the Upper Bollinger Band value
    4. **Query/Filter Rate Check**: The ratio of the result from the filter and query at runtime to only the result from the filter is expressed as a percentage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alarm

The [Alarm](/en/monitor/alarm) module enables adding alarms that will occur when a specific condition is triggered. Alarm works based on a specified Threshold value.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Features">
    - **Basic Purpose**: Create warnings based on specified threshold value
    - **Configuration**: Name, Description, and Threshold value for the alarm are determined
    - **Trigger Type**: Alarm's Trigger Type is selected
    - **Execution Frequency**: Alarm's execution frequency is determined with the Trigger Every field
    - **Actions**: Selection of the action to be performed when the alarm is triggered is provided
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trigger Types">
    - **Application Logs Count**: Log Type must be selected
    - **Elasticsearch Types**: Connection Definition must be selected
    - **Kubernetes**: Pod and Node health status monitoring
    - **Certificate**: SSL and JWK certificate duration tracking
  </Accordion>
