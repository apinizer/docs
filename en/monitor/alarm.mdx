## What is Alarm?

### Basic Concept

Alarm is a monitoring system that continuously checks specific conditions in your system and sends notifications when these conditions are met.

    height="800"
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />

### Step 1: Basic Information

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name - Required">
    Enter a unique name for the alarm. This name:
    - Must be unique within the project
    - Cannot start with a space
    - The system automatically checks the availability of the name

    **Good Name Examples:**
    - `Elasticsearch CPU Monitoring`
    - `Kubernetes Pod Health Status`
    - `SSL Certificate Duration Tracking`
    - `Application Log Count Monitoring`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Description - Optional">
    You can enter descriptive information about the alarm:
    - Maximum 1000 characters
    - Used to explain the purpose and scope of the alarm
    - Displayed on the list page

    **Example Descriptions:**
    - `Created to monitor CPU usage of Elasticsearch cluster`
    - `Used to track health status of Kubernetes pods`
    - `Configured to warn before SSL certificates expire`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Status - Default: Active">
    Determines the active/passive status of the alarm:
    - **Active**: Alarm runs, scheduled checks are performed
    - **Passive**: Alarm is stopped, no checks are performed (historical data is preserved)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Trigger Type and Threshold Value

#### Trigger Types

Determines when the alarm will be triggered. Select one of the following trigger types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Kubernetes" icon="server">
    - Pod Health Status
    - Node Health Status
    - K8S Node CPU Percentage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Elasticsearch" icon="database">
    - Health Status
    - CPU Percentage
    - Disk Percentage
    - Logs in Database
  </Card>
  <Card title="Certificate" icon="certificate">
    - SSL Certificate Remaining Duration
    - JWK Certificate Remaining Duration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Application Log" icon="file-lines">
    - Application Log Count
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Kubernetes Trigger Types">
    **Pod Health Status**: Checks the health status of Kubernetes pods. Alarm is triggered when any pod becomes unhealthy. Does not require threshold value.

    **Node Health Status**: Checks the health status of Kubernetes nodes. Alarm is triggered when any node becomes unhealthy. Does not require threshold value.

    **K8S Node CPU Percentage**: Checks the CPU usage percentage of Kubernetes nodes. Alarm is triggered when CPU usage percentage exceeds the threshold value. Requires threshold value (e.g., 80 = 80%).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Elasticsearch Trigger Types">
    **Elasticsearch Health Status**: Checks the health status of Elasticsearch cluster. Alarm is triggered when cluster becomes unhealthy. Does not require threshold value. Requires connection definition.

    **Elasticsearch CPU Percentage**: Checks the CPU usage percentage of Elasticsearch cluster. Alarm is triggered when CPU usage percentage exceeds the threshold value. Requires threshold value (e.g., 80 = 80%). Requires connection definition.

    **Elasticsearch Disk Percentage**: Checks the disk usage percentage of Elasticsearch cluster. Alarm is triggered when disk usage percentage exceeds the threshold value. Requires threshold value (e.g., 90 = 90%). Requires connection definition.

    **Elasticsearch Logs in Database**: Checks whether Elasticsearch logs are in the database. Alarm is triggered when logs are in the database. Does not require threshold value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Certificate Trigger Types">
    **SSL Certificate Remaining Duration**: Checks the remaining duration of SSL certificates. Alarm is triggered when remaining duration is less than the threshold value. Requires threshold value (e.g., 30 = 30 days).

    **JWK Certificate Remaining Duration**: Checks the remaining duration of JWK certificates. Alarm is triggered when remaining duration is less than the threshold value. Requires threshold value (e.g., 30 = 30 days).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Application Log Trigger Types">
    **Application Log Count**: Checks the count of a specific application log type. Alarm is triggered when log count exceeds the threshold value. Requires threshold value (e.g., 10000 = 10,000 records). Log type must be selected.

    **Supported Log Types:**
    - Manager Logs
    - Gateway Logs
    - Cache Logs
    - Integration Logs
    - Portal Logs
    - Audit Logs Manager
    - Audit Logs ACL
    - And more...
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Threshold Value

Threshold value determines when the alarm will be triggered. Different units are used according to the trigger type:

| Trigger Type | Unit | Example Value | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|----------|
| K8S Node CPU Percentage | % | 80 | When CPU usage exceeds 80% |
| Elasticsearch CPU Percentage | % | 80 | When CPU usage exceeds 80% |
| Elasticsearch Disk Percentage | % | 90 | When disk usage exceeds 90% |
| SSL Certificate Remaining Duration | Days | 30 | When remaining duration is less than 30 days |
| JWK Certificate Remaining Duration | Days | 30 | When remaining duration is less than 30 days |
| Application Log Count | Records | 10000 | When log count exceeds 10,000 |

<Tip>
**Threshold Value Recommendations:**
- **CPU Monitoring**: Between 70-80%
- **Disk Monitoring**: Between 80-90%
- **Certificate Tracking**: Between 30-60 days
- **Log Count**: According to system capacity
</Tip>

#### Connection Definition

Some trigger types require Elasticsearch connection:

**Trigger Types Requiring Connection:**
- Elasticsearch Health Status
- Elasticsearch CPU Percentage
- Elasticsearch Disk Percentage

**Trigger Types Not Requiring Connection:**
- Kubernetes trigger types
- Certificate trigger types
- Application log trigger types

<Note>
Elasticsearch connection is selected from connections created on the **Connection Management** page. Connection must be active and accessible.
</Note>

### Step 3: Scheduling Settings

Determine how frequently the alarm will be checked. Scheduling is done using **Cron Expression**.

#### Common Scheduling Examples

| Description | Cron Expression | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Every hour | `0 0 * ? * *` | For general monitoring (most common) |
| Every 30 minutes | `0 */30 * ? * *` | For critical systems |
| Every 15 minutes | `0 */15 * ? * *` | For very critical systems |
| Every day at 09:00 | `0 0 9 * ? *` | For daily reporting |
| Every 5 minutes | `0 */5 * ? * *` | For situations requiring very frequent checks |

<Tip>
**Recommendations:**
- **General Monitoring**: Every hour
- **Critical Systems**: Every 15-30 minutes
- **Certificate Tracking**: Every day at 09:00
- **Resource Monitoring**: Every 30 minutes
</Tip>

### Step 4: Notification Recipients

Configure recipients who will receive notifications when the alarm is triggered:
