  <Accordion title="API (Application Programming Interface)">
    API (_Application Programming Interface_ - Application Programming Interface) is an interface that facilitates one application 'consuming' the capabilities or data of another application. By defining stable, simplified entry points to application logic and data, it enables developers to easily access and reuse application logic created by other developers.

    Today, APIs are widely used as a **contract** that determines the structure of communication between client and server in general or local network environments, mobile or web-based applications. In the Apinizer context, the word API refers to _server-side Web API_ with this more limited meaning.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Management">
    API management is the set of operations for managing, formatting, deploying, and related operations of APIs in a secure and scalable environment. The goal of API management is to meet the requirements of API stakeholders in a quality and cost-effective manner.

    API management needs may vary from organization to organization, but basic functions such as API security, monitoring, and version control are generally common.

    <Info>
      **Apinizer is an API Management Platform.**
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Lifecycle">
    All steps of an API from the creation of its idea, determination of its requirements, design and development, testing, deployment and fulfillment of security requirements, support, monitoring of its operation, improvement of its performance, pricing and sale, use, feedback, update, versioning, or deprecation of a version form the API Lifecycle.

    Organizations can customize how they will operate the steps of the lifecycle within the framework of their own needs.

    <Info>
      **Apinizer supports the API Lifecycle and provides a platform where API Stakeholders can work collaboratively within their own roles.**
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Gateway">
    _API Gateway_ is the common name for software that solves many tasks such as security, logging, traffic management, message transformation, protocol conversion, message validation, and similar without touching the API code, by making configuration at an external point.

    It is placed in front of APIs and API message traffic passes through the API Gateway. Thus, all kinds of control, transformation or customization on these messages becomes possible.

    **How API Gateway works:**

    1. The request sent by the client is received by the API Proxy on the API Gateway
    2. API Proxy becomes a client to the API and receives the responses returned by the API
    3. API Proxy returns the responses to the client itself

    Through configurations made with the API Gateway software, the behavior of the API Proxy is customized, and thus requirements such as security, traffic management, message transformations, service migration, and similar can be managed from a central point.

    <Info>
      **Apinizer provides an advanced, easy-to-use, horizontally scalable API Gateway.**

</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Proxy">
    API Proxy is the proxy of an API on the API Gateway. The client actually communicates with the API Proxy. API Proxy becomes a client to the API and receives the responses returned by the API and returns the response to the Client itself.

    API Proxy provides functions such as security, traffic management, and message transformation without touching the API's business logic.

    For detailed information, see the [What is API Proxy?](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-api-proxy) page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Policy">
    Policy is configurable components that define operations applied to messages in API Proxies. Policies provide various functions such as security, validation, transformation, and traffic management.

    Policies are configured and reused with form-based interfaces without writing code.

    For detailed information, see the [What is Policy?](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-policy) page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DB-2-API">
    Many applications use APIs developed for database operations that do not require special business logic. Although it is easy to develop this type of API, it is necessary to create a programming environment, have people with developer identities work, deploy the developed APIs to a server, and set up a server for this.

    **Apinizer enables even non-developers to create and deploy a database operation API in minutes with DB-2-API.**

    **Supported Operations:**
    * Native SQL statements
    * Stored Procedure calls
    * Returning cursor results
    * Batch operations

    **Advantages of DB-2-API:**
    * Creating APIs without writing code
    * No need for separate server installation
    * APIs can be deployed in minutes
    * Shortens API development time for database operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Script-2-API">
    Some APIs are created to expose an algorithm or to enable a method to be executed by other stakeholders. The algorithm or method may already exist or may need to be newly developed. In both cases, this requires steps such as doing it in a software development environment, packaging the API, and placing it on a server where it will be deployed.

    **Apinizer enables users to instantly open an API by writing (or pasting existing) JavaScript or Groovy code with Script-2-API.**

    **Features:**
    * JavaScript or Groovy code support
    * Use of request/response messages
    * Ability to use desired parts of request/response messages in the code
    * No need for tasks such as setting up a separate server
    * APIs can be deployed in minutes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mock API Creator">
    Mock API Creator provides the ability to instantly create Mock APIs without any server or code writing need. It is used for starting frontend development before backend development is completed, testing API design, and in integration tests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Platform Terms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment">
    Environment is the physical or logical environment where API Proxies run. Each environment has its own Gateway instances and configurations. It corresponds to the Kubernetes Namespace concept.

    For detailed information, see the [What is Environment?](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-environment) page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Project">
    Project is a logical grouping that enables API Proxies, Policies, or other definitions to be managed on a project basis.

    **Apinizer enables the creation of Projects, and API Proxies, Policies, or other definitions can be managed on a project basis.**

    For detailed information, see the [What is Project?](/en/concepts/core-concepts/what-is-project) page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Team">
    Team is the group formed by members working on a project. It enables operations such as adding users to Projects or Role assignment to be done in bulk through Teams.

    **Apinizer allows the creation of Teams, adding Users to Teams with different Roles, assigning Teams to Projects with different roles, or assigning Roles to Teams.**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User">
    **It is the name given to stakeholders who use Apinizer interfaces. From this perspective, all stakeholders except API Consumer are Users. It should not be confused with Clients accessing API Proxies.**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Role">
    It is the name given to permission groups. **Apinizer provides certain roles as default values and allows the creation of new roles.**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Privilege">
    A user needs to have the privilege related to a specific task to be able to do that task.

    **In the Apinizer context, Privileges come pre-defined and are used for creating/updating Roles. Privileges are not directly assigned to Users.**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Namespace">
    Corresponds to the Namespace concept in the Kubernetes environment. The environment concept in the Apinizer Platform corresponds to the Namespace concept in the Kubernetes environment. Each environment is created as a Namespace in Kubernetes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Relative Path">
    The prefix that all API Proxy relative paths in a project will start with. For example, when the project relative path is "account", the API proxy relative path appears as `/account/proxy1`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Access URL">
    Each environment has its own access address (URL). API Proxies in the environment can be accessed through this address.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
