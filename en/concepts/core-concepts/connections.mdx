title: "Connections"
description: "Connections are configurations used in the Apinizer platform for API Proxies and API Integrator tasks to connect to external systems. They provide access to external resources such as databases, message queues, and email servers. Connections are defined once and can be used by multiple API Proxies or tasks. They are managed and updated centrally, and connection information is stored encrypted."

## Connection Features

A connection is a configuration containing information necessary to access an external system. Connections are defined once and can be used by multiple API Proxies or tasks.

## Connection Configuration

When creating a connection, the following information is defined:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Information">
    * **Connection Name**: Unique name identifying the connection
    * **Connection Type**: Database, message queue, etc.
    * **Description**: Descriptive information about the connection (optional)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection Information">
    * **Host/URL**: Server address or connection URL
    * **Port**: Connection port (varies by connection type)
    * **Database Name**: Database name (for database connections)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication">
    * **Username**: Username for the connection
    * **Password**: Password for the connection (stored encrypted)
    * **Credential Usage**: Whether credentials will be used
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Advanced Settings">
    * **Connection Pool**: Connection pool settings (min/max pool size, etc.)
    * **Timeout**: Connection timeout settings
    * **SSL/TLS**: Secure connection settings
    * **Deploy to Worker**: Whether to deploy to Worker
    * **Enabled**: Whether the connection is active
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connection Usage

Connections are used in the following situations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Proxy" icon="server">
    **DB-2-API** can perform database queries
    
    SQL queries can be executed using database connections and results can be returned as API responses.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Integrator" icon="diagram-project">
    Access to external systems is provided in **Task Flow**s
    
    Connections are used in Task Flows for operations such as database queries, message queue operations, and email sending.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Connectors" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Used for connectors to connect to external systems
    
    Connectors use connections to access different systems and exchange data.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Policies" icon="shield">
    Can be used for access to external systems within policies
    
    Some policies can communicate with external systems using connections.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Connection Security

<Warning>
**Important Security Notes:**
* Connection information (username, password) is stored encrypted
* Secure connections (SSL/TLS) must be used in production environments
* Connection information is never written to log files
* Connection information should be updated regularly
</Warning>

<Info>
Since connections are managed centrally, when a connection's information changes, all API Proxies and tasks using this connection automatically use the updated information.
</Info>

## Connection Management

After connections are created:

* **Testable**: Connections can be tested and validated
* **Updatable**: Connection information can be updated
* **Deletable**: Connections that are no longer used can be deleted
* **Environment-Based**: Connections can be assigned to specific environments

<Tip>
When creating connections, optimize connection pool settings according to your system load. Use low pool size for small systems and high pool size for high-traffic systems.
</Tip>
