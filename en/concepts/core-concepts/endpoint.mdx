title: "Endpoint"
description: "Endpoint is a specific URL path in an API Proxy where requests from clients are received. Each endpoint represents a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and path combination. Endpoints are defined under Client Route and are the gateways of the API Proxy to the outside world. Clients use the API by sending requests to these endpoints."

## Endpoint Structure

An endpoint contains the following information:

```
GET /api/v1/products
│   │   │  │
│   │   │  └─ Resource
│   │   └─ Version
│   └─ Base Path
└─ HTTP Method
```

### Example Endpoints

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="GET /api/v1/products" icon="list">
    Get product list
  </Card>
  <Card title="GET /api/v1/products/{id}" icon="eye">
    Get single product detail
  </Card>
  <Card title="POST /api/v1/products" icon="plus">
    Create new product
  </Card>
  <Card title="PUT /api/v1/products/{id}" icon="pencil">
    Update product
  </Card>
  <Card title="DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}" icon="trash">
    Delete product
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Endpoint and Client Route Relationship

Endpoints are defined under Client Route:

```
Client Route: /api/v1/*
│
├─ GET /api/v1/products
├─ GET /api/v1/products/{id}
├─ POST /api/v1/products
├─ PUT /api/v1/products/{id}
└─ DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}
```

<Info>
Client Route is the top-level configuration for endpoints. Multiple endpoints can be defined under a Client Route. Endpoints are specific path and method combinations within the Client Route's path.
</Info>

## Endpoint Configuration

When creating an endpoint, the following information is defined:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Information">
    * **Path**: The URL path of the endpoint
    * **Method**: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    * **Operation ID**: Unique identifier of the endpoint
    * **Description**: Description of the endpoint
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Parameters">
    * **Query Parameters**: Query string parameters in the URL
    * **Path Parameters**: Dynamic parameters in the URL path (e.g., `{id}`)
    * **Header Parameters**: HTTP header parameters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Request and Response">
    * **Request Body**: Request body schema (JSON, XML, etc.)
    * **Response**: Response schema and status codes
    * **Content-Type**: Request and response content types
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Backend Mapping">
    * **Backend Path**: Corresponding path in the backend
    * **Backend Method**: HTTP method in the backend
    * **Path Rewrite**: Path transformation rules
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Endpoint and Policy Relationship

Endpoint-specific policies can be applied:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Endpoint-Based Security" icon="shield">
    Different security policies for each endpoint
    
    Security mechanisms such as OAuth2, JWT, API Key can be configured at the endpoint level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Endpoint-Based Rate Limiting" icon="gauge">
    Different rate limit for each endpoint
    
    Request count and bandwidth limits can be defined at the endpoint level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Endpoint-Based Transformation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Different transformation rules for each endpoint

  </Card>
  <Card title="Endpoint-Based Validation" icon="check-circle">
    Different validation rules for each endpoint
    
    Request/Response validation, schema validation can be configured at the endpoint level.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Endpoint Versioning

Endpoints can be versioned:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Version 1" icon="1">
    `/api/v1/products`
    
    First version. Basic functionality.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version 2" icon="2">
    `/api/v2/products`
    
    Enhanced version. New features.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version 3" icon="3">
    `/api/v3/products`
    
    Latest version. Current API.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Backward Compatibility">
    Backward compatibility is maintained. Old versions continue to work and new versions do not affect old versions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gradual Migration">
    Gradual migration can be performed. Clients can migrate to the new version at their own pace.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version Management">
    Different versions can be deployed to different environments and can run simultaneously. Versioning enables API lifecycle management.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Endpoint and Routing Relationship

Endpoints serve as a bridge between Client Route and Upstream Target:

```
Client Request
   │
   ▼
Client Route (/api/v1/*)
   │
   ▼
Endpoint (GET /api/v1/products)
   │
   │ Routing Logic
   │ (Load Balancing, Failover)
   │
   ▼
Upstream Target (http://backend:8080/products)
   │
   ▼
Backend API
```

<Info>
While routing requests from Client Route to Upstream Target, the endpoint applies routing logic and policies.
