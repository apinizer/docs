title: "Connector"
description: "Connector is a component in the Apinizer platform that enables connecting to different systems, sending data to these systems, or retrieving data from them. Connectors are used in four main areas: creating integration scenarios in API Integrator Task Flows, providing protocol conversion by creating Connector API Proxies (e.g., HTTP to MQTT), executing actions in Alarm and Monitoring situations, and sending API traffic logs to different systems. Each connector is specialized to communicate with a specific system or protocol. They can be easily used through form-based configuration without writing code."

## Connector Usage Areas

Connectors are used in four main areas in the Apinizer platform:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="In API Integrator Task Flows" icon="diagram-project">
    
    Connections to different systems are established in Task Flows and data exchange is provided. Connectors are visually connected to create integration scenarios.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Proxy Creation" icon="server">
    
    API Proxies can be created with connectors. This enables protocol conversion such as HTTP to MQTT. For example, data can be placed in a message queue via HTTP protocol.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Alarm, Monitoring and Anomaly Detection" icon="bell">

When configuring connectors, the following information is defined:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Selection">
    The connection (Connection) to be used by the connector is selected. The connection must have been defined previously.
