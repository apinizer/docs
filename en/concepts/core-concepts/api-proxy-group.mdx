title: "API Proxy Group"
description: "API Proxy Group is a structure in the Apinizer platform that enables managing multiple API Proxies as a group and applying common policies from a central point. It enables logical grouping of related API Proxies, and policies and settings defined at the group level are automatically applied to all API Proxies included in the group."
---

## API Proxy Group Concept

API Proxy Group enables logical grouping of related API Proxies. Policies and settings defined at the group level are automatically applied to all API Proxies included in the group.

## API Proxy Group and API Proxy Relationship

API Proxy Group logically brings together multiple API Proxies. Policies and settings defined at the group level are automatically applied to all API Proxies included in the group.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Group-Level Policies" icon="shield">
    Policies defined at the group level are applied to all group members
    
    * Global Policies
    * Pre-flow Policies
    * Post-flow Policies
    * Fault Handler Policies
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Group-Level Settings" icon="gear">
    Settings defined at the group level are applied to all group members
    
    * CORS Settings
    * Error Messages
    * Timeout Settings
    * Retry Settings
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Each API Proxy within an API Proxy Group can also define its own specific policies and settings. API Proxy level settings take priority over group level settings.
</Info>

### Request Flow and Policy Application

The following diagram shows how request and response flow occurs through the Gateway with the API Proxy Group mechanism:

```

When a request arrives at the API Proxy Group, **policies on the API Proxy Group** are executed first. Then the relevant API Proxy's policies are applied.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. Request Arrival" icon="arrow-right">
    Request arrives at API Proxy Group
    
    Client request is routed to the API Proxy Group endpoint.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="2. Group Policies" icon="shield">
    API Proxy Group policies are executed
    
    All policies defined at the group level are applied.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="3. API Proxy Policies" icon="network-wired">
    API Proxy policies are executed
    
    The relevant API Proxy's own policies are applied.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Multiple Group Membership

An API Proxy can be added to multiple API Proxy Groups. This allows the same API Proxy to be used in different configurations for different groups.

<Warning>
When an API Proxy is a member of multiple groups, separate endpoints and policies are applied for each group. Group-based management and isolation are provided.
</Warning>

### Direct Access Control

By prohibiting direct access through the API Proxy, it can be ensured that access is only possible through the API Proxy Group. This enables:

* **Centralized Management**: All access is controlled through the group
* **Security**: Direct API Proxy access is prevented
* **Consistency**: All requests pass through group policies

<Info>
When direct access is prohibited, the API Proxy can only be accessed through the group. This ensures that group-level policies and settings are always applied.
</Info>

### Endpoint Matching Logic

When an API Proxy Group has the same endpoint due to different API Proxies, the request **falls to the first matching endpoint**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Endpoint Matching Priority">
    Endpoint matching order:
    
    1. **First Matching Endpoint**: Request is routed to the first matching endpoint
    2. **API Proxy Order**: The order of API Proxies within the group is important
    3. **Path and Method Match**: Path and HTTP method matching is checked
    
    <Tip>
    If there are multiple API Proxies with the same endpoint, the order within the group is important. The first matching endpoint is used.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Definition File Creation">
    The API Proxy Group definition file is created by combining the definition files of all API Proxies it contains:
    
    * **Combination Process**: Definition files of all group members are combined
    * **Endpoint Combination**: All endpoints are collected in a single definition file
    * **Policy Combination**: Group and API Proxy policies are combined
    * **Swagger Combination**: Swagger definitions are combined to create group Swagger
    
    <Tip>
    The definition file combination process is performed automatically. Definitions of all API Proxies within the group are collected in a single file.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
