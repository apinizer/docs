title: "What is Policy?"
description: "Policy is a configurable component that defines operations applied to messages in API Proxies. Policies provide various functions such as security, validation, transformation, and traffic management, and are configured through form-based interfaces without writing code."

## Policy Concept

Policy is a configurable component used in API Gateway to process requests from clients and responses from Backend APIs according to specific rules. Policies work based on configuration and do not require writing code.

Through policies, you can perform the following operations:

- Apply security rules. Authentication (Basic Auth, OAuth2, OIDC, JWT, etc.) and authorization (role-based access control) mechanisms are defined through policies.
- Perform traffic management. You can protect your APIs from overloads with quota (number of requests that can be made within a certain period) and rate limiting policies per user or application.
- Provide data transformation. You can transform incoming requests or outgoing responses into different formats (e.g., converting XML to JSON, reformatting data structure).
- Customize error messages. You can translate error messages returned by the system into corporate standards or user-friendly language.
- Apply business logic. You can define simple business rules at the API Gateway level using scripting languages such as JavaScript or Groovy or conditional logic policies.
- Enrich message content. You can add headers to requests or responses, add metadata, or mask sensitive data.

Policies define the operations applied during message processing in an API Proxy. Each policy performs a specific function and runs at a specific point in the message flow. You can instantly enable, update, or disable policies through drag-and-drop, parameter entry, or configuration selections in the interface.

## Purpose and Benefits of Policies

**Centralized Control**

API behavior, security, and performance are managed from a single point. This ensures consistency in distributed systems and reduces management complexity.

**Access Control Policies**

Authentication, authorization, and access permissions to API resources are defined through policies. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures security.

**Reusability**

A policy defined once can be used by multiple APIs, endpoints, or services. This simplifies policy management and speeds up the development process.

**Reducing Code Maintenance Burden**

Security, data transformation, and validation operations are performed in gateway configuration, not in code. This reduces complexity in application code and lowers maintenance costs.

**Consistency**

Since all APIs are subject to the same policies, enterprise-wide security and performance standards are applied consistently. Exceptions remain minimal.

**Rapid Response and Flexibility**

Policies can be instantly disabled, updated, or redeployed. This enables rapid response to security threats, resolution of performance issues, or adaptation to business rule changes.

## Policy Pipeline

Policies run sequentially in a pipeline:

```
Request Pipeline:
├─ Pre-flow Policies (Before request)
├─ Conditional Policies
├─ Routing Step
├─ Post-flow Policies (After request)
└─ Response Pipeline:
   └─ Post-flow Policies (After response)
   └─ Fault Handler Policies (In error condition)
```

## Policy Usage Types

### Local Policy

Valid only in the API Proxy or API Proxy Group where it was created. If the API Proxy or API Proxy Group where it is located is deleted, the policy is also deleted.

Export, import, activate, and deactivate operations can be performed where it is located.

### Global Policy

Policies created on the Global Policies page. Can be used by multiple API Proxies or API Proxy Groups.

If a change is made to a global policy, all API Proxies and API Proxy Groups using the policy enter the "Redeploy Required" state.

All related API Proxies/API Proxy Groups can be deployed together through the bulk deploy operation on this screen.

Additionally, policy export, import, activate, and deactivate operations can also be performed from these screens.

**Localizing Global Policy:**

A policy created globally may need to be customized when used in an API Proxy/API Proxy Group.

In this case, click on the policy added to the API Proxy/API Proxy Group and click the "Localize" button in the upper right corner to make it local with a single click.

**Where Global Policy is Used:**

Tracking where a global policy is used in which API proxies, API proxy groups, or policy groups is critical in management and update processes.

On each policy detail page, policy usage information is displayed:

* **Used in API Proxies Panel:** This section displays the list of API Proxies using the policy.
* **Used in API Proxy Groups Panel:** This section displays the list of API Proxy groups using the policy.
* **Used in Policy Groups Panel:** This section displays the list of policy groups containing this policy.

### Global and Local Policy Comparison

| Global Policy | Local Policy |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can be used in multiple API Proxies | Used only in one API Proxy |
| Centrally managed | Managed per proxy |
| Updated once, all usages are affected | Separate update required for each proxy |
| High reusability | Low reusability |

## Policy Application Points

Policies can be applied at three different levels:

| Application Point | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| API Proxy Group | Applied to all API Proxies in a group |
| API Proxy | Applied to all methods/endpoints within a specific API Proxy |
| Method/Endpoint | Valid only for the relevant method or endpoint |

For detailed information about the application order of policies in the message flow, the working logic at API Proxy Group/API Proxy/Endpoint levels, and the visual flow diagram, refer to the [Message Processing and Policy Application](/en/concepts/core-concepts/message-processing-and-policy-application) page.

## Policy Structure

Policies share the same basic structure despite their functional differences.

### General Information Panel

Each policy's name, description, and whether it is active are common fields.

After the common fields, policy-specific configuration fields are located.

### Conditions

Policies can be customized to run only when certain conditions are met.

**Example:**

- Run if `status` parameter is `"pending"`.
- Execute if `userId` field is in the list `#user1#user2#user3`.

This feature enables policies to work **dynamically and context-aware**.

When "in list" or "not in list" is selected as the condition value comparison operator, the # sign should be used to separate list values. For example, user1#user2#user3.

### Error Message Customization

Messages returned for errors that may occur during policy execution can be customized. This allows developers to customize error messages returned to clients in corporate or understandable formats.

Each policy can customize messages to be returned when an error occurs:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| HTTP Status Code | Default system code |
| Error Code | Default error code |
| Original Message | Default error message |
| Customized HTTP Status Code | A different HTTP status code is returned |
| Customized Error Code | A different error code is determined |
| Customized Error Message | Custom error message is written |

**Note:** While error codes and messages can be customized specifically for that policy in the policy definition interface, error customization can also be done platform-wide.

## Policy Configuration

Policies are configured through form-based interfaces. Each policy type has its own configuration options.

### Global Policies

Policies can be defined globally and used in multiple API Proxies. This enables:

* Prevention of policy duplication
* Centralized management
* Consistency maintenance

### Policy Groups

Policy Groups enable grouping and managing related policies together. Through Policy Groups:

* **Centralized Management**: Related policies are collected under a single group
* **Easy Application**: When a Policy Group is added to an API Proxy, all policies in the group are automatically applied
* **Reusability**: The same policy combination can be used in multiple API Proxies
* **Versioning**: Policy Groups can be versioned and different versions can be used in different API Proxies

<Info>
  For detailed Policy Groups information, you can refer to the [Policy Management](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/policy-management) page.
</Info>

## Policy and API Proxy Relationship

Policies are fundamental components of API Proxies:

* **Within API Proxy**: Each API Proxy contains its own policies. These policies are specific to the API Proxy.
* **Within API Proxy Group**: Policy Groups are policy collections that can be used in multiple API Proxies.
* **Global Policies**: Policies defined globally can be used in multiple API Proxies.

Policies can be added to an API Proxy at the following levels:

```
API Proxy Group
├─ Group Pre-flow Policies
├─ Group Post-flow Policies
└─ Group Fault Handler Policies
    │
    └─ API Proxy
        ├─ Proxy Pre-flow Policies
        ├─ Proxy Conditional Policies
        ├─ Proxy Post-flow Policies
        └─ Proxy Fault Handler Policies
            │
            └─ Endpoint/Method
                ├─ Endpoint Pre-flow Policies
                ├─ Endpoint Post-flow Policies
                └─ Endpoint Fault Handler Policies
```

<Info>
  For detailed information about policy application levels and execution order, you can refer to the [Message Processing and Policy Application](/en/concepts/core-concepts/message-processing-and-policy-application) page.
</Info>

## Policy Creation and Management

### Policy Creation

When creating a policy, the following steps are followed:

1. **Policy Type Selection**: The type of policy to be created is selected
2. **Configuration**: Policy parameters are configured through form-based interface
3. **Conditions**: Conditions are optionally defined
4. **Error Message Customization**: Custom messages are defined for error conditions
5. **Activation**: Policy is activated
6. **Deployment**: API Proxy is redeployed for changes to take effect

<Info>
  For detailed policy creation and management, you can refer to the [Policy Management](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/policy-management) page.
</Info>

## Policy Execution Order

Policies run in the order they are defined. This order is important because:

* Security checks must be performed first
* Validation should be performed next
* Transformation should be performed last

The policy execution order is as follows:

1. **API Proxy Group Pre-flow Policies**
2. **API Proxy Pre-flow Policies**
3. **Endpoint Pre-flow Policies**
4. **Conditional Policies**
5. **Routing Step**
6. **Post-flow Policies (Request)**
7. **Backend API Request**
8. **Post-flow Policies (Response)**
9. **Fault Handler Policies** (In error condition)

## Best Practices

- Create policies to be reusable
- Prefer global policy when possible
- Make error messages user-friendly
- Don't unnecessarily complicate policy conditions
- Perform redeploy operation after changes
