## Topology Selection Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When Should Topology 1 (Test/PoC) Be Used?">
    **Usage Scenarios:**
    * Proof of Concept (POC) projects
    * Development and test environments
    * Low-traffic applications (< 500K requests/day)
    * Quick installation requirements
    * Limited resources and budget
    * For training and learning purposes
    
    **Advantages:**
    * Lowest resource requirements
    * Quick installation
    * Low cost
    * Simple management
    
    **Disadvantages:**
    * Single point of failure risk
    * No high availability
    * Not suitable for production
    * Limited scalability
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When Should Topology 2 (Professional) Be Used?">
    **Usage Scenarios:**
    * Medium-scale production environments
    * Medium-traffic applications (500K - 3M requests/day)
    * Basic high availability requirements
    * Situations requiring budget optimization
    * Enterprise applications
    
    **Advantages:**
    * Load balancing between worker nodes
    * Medium-level resource requirements
    * Suitable for production
    * Flexible scaling
    
    **Disadvantages:**
    * Limited high availability
    * Database single point of failure risk
    * No geographic distribution
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When Should Topology 3 (High Availability) Be Used?">
    **Usage Scenarios:**
    * Critical production environments
    * High-traffic applications (> 3M requests/day)
    * High availability requirements (%99.9+ uptime)
    * Critical business processes
    * Data security and replication requirements
    
    **Advantages:**
    * High availability (%99.9+)
    * Automatic failover
    * Data replication
    * Load balancing
    * Zero-downtime updates
    
    **Disadvantages:**
    * High resource requirements
    * Complex installation
    * High cost
    * Cluster management requirements
  </Accordion>

## Scaling Strategies

### Vertical Scaling

Increasing single server performance:
* CPU and RAM increase
* Disk capacity increase
* Network bandwidth increase

**Usage:** When you want to use all resources

### Horizontal Scaling

Increasing server count:
* Increasing worker node count
* Increasing MongoDB replica set node count
* Increasing Elasticsearch cluster node count

**Usage:** For high availability and traffic increase requirements

<Warning>
  **Important Notes:**
  
  * **Do not use Test/PoC installations for load testing purposes!** If you want to evaluate the correct configuration for load testing, please refer to our [Benchmark Results](/en/concepts/benchmark-results) page or contact us.
  
  * **We do not recommend installing on a single server for production environments.** Please evaluate such an installation configuration only for PoC environments.
  
  * Requirements for each topology are for **minimum** configuration. They should be increased according to your service loads.
</Warning>
