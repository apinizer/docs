## Section Content Summary

In this section, you can find all topology and architectural information necessary for installing the Apinizer platform. Below, the headings and scopes within the section are summarized:

### Deployment Topologies

The **[Deployment Models](/en/concepts/deployment/deployment-models)** page explains in detail three basic installation topologies that Apinizer can use according to different requirements:

* **Topology 1: Test and PoC** - Ideal for test and proof of concept environments with quick installation and low resource requirements
* **Topology 2: Professional Installation** - Structure that provides load balancing between worker nodes for medium-scale production environments
* **Topology 3: High Availability** - HA structure that provides %99.9+ uptime, automatic failover, and data replication for critical production environments

Detailed system requirements, hardware specifications, network topology, and capacity planning information for each topology can be found on the relevant pages:

* **[Topology 1: Test and PoC](/en/concepts/deployment/topology-test-poc)** - 2 servers, minimum resource requirements
* **[Topology 2: Professional Installation](/en/concepts/deployment/topology-professional)** - 5 servers, Data Plane priority load balancing
* **[Topology 3: High Availability](/en/concepts/deployment/topology-ha)** - 12 servers, full High Available structure

### Network Topology and Port Requirements

The **[Network Topology and Port Requirements](/en/concepts/deployment/network-topology)** page contains network configuration information critical for secure deployment:

* **DMZ and LAN Zones** - Secure network segmentation and component placement
* **Firewall Rules** - Required port and protocol requirements for inter-component communication
* **Kubernetes Port Requirements** - Communication ports between control-plane and worker nodes
* **Apinizer Component Ports** - Manager, Worker, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch port configurations
* **Network Segmentation** - VLAN, subnet, and routing configuration recommendations
* **Security Layers** - Defense in depth strategy and security best practices

This page contains all technical details needed for network and security teams to configure firewall rules and define port access permissions.

## Installation Prerequisites

Before installing the Apinizer Platform, ensure that appropriate prerequisites are available. Before starting installation, verify that the operating system is supported and that you have the necessary development platforms.

### Supported Operating Systems

Since Apinizer runs on Kubernetes, it supports all operating systems that have Kubernetes installed. However, the from-scratch installations in the documentation are aimed at Linux-based operating systems.

### Components Required by Apinizer

| Name | Version/Requirement |
|------|---------------------|
| Kubernetes / Tanzu / OpenShift / RKE2 | There is no version dependency. Since Apinizer images are provided rootless from DockerHub, they can be run on any container orchestration-based platform. |
| Mongodb | There is no version dependency. However, the MongoDB to be installed must be configured as a replica set (Even if it is a single node, it must be configured as a replica set. It should not be configured as a Standalone Instance). |
| Elasticsearch | Minimum version 7.9.2 is supported. The officially recommended version is 8.17.10. Versions above 8.17.10 are not recommended as they have not been tested. |

#### Elasticsearch Version Support

| Version | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Elasticsearch 7.9.2** | Supported | Minimum supported version |
| **Elasticsearch 8.17.10** | Officially Recommended | ✓✓ Recommended version |
| **Elasticsearch 8.x (< 8.17.10)** | Tested | No official support, can be used |
| **Elasticsearch 8.x (> 8.17.10)** | Not Recommended | Not recommended as it has not been tested |

## Installation Process and Related Documentation

The topology and architectural information in this section is used in the planning phase of the installation process. For installation operations, it is recommended to follow the steps below:

### 1. Planning and Preparation (This Section)

* **Topology Selection**: Select the appropriate topology according to your business requirements ([Deployment Models](/en/concepts/deployment/deployment-models))
