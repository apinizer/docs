title: "Topology 1: Test and PoC"
description: "You can install Apinizer in test and Proof of Concept environments, determine system requirements, configure network topology, perform capacity planning, and meet hardware requirements."
---

This page is prepared for those who want to install Apinizer in **Test and Proof of Concept (PoC)** environments. This topology is designed for quick installation, low resource requirements, and minimum cost.

<Warning>
  **Important:** This topology is **only** suitable for test, development, and PoC environments. It should not be used for production environments. If you want to evaluate the correct configuration for load testing, please refer to our [Benchmark Results](/en/concepts/benchmark-results) page.
</Warning>

## Overview

Topology 1 is a simple topology that provides quick installation with minimum resource requirements. All components run on 2 servers.

## 1. System Requirements

For detailed system requirements, you can refer to the [Overview](/en/concepts/deployment/overview) page.

### Operating System

* **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS** or **RHEL 9.x**
* Minimum kernel version: 5.4+
* SELinux: Disabled (for RHEL) or Permissive mode

### Software Components

| Component | Version/Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Kubernetes** | 1.31.0+ (or any supported version) |
| **Docker/Containerd** | Version compatible with Kubernetes |
| **MongoDB** | Any version (must be configured as Replica Set) |
| **Elasticsearch** | 7.9.2+ (officially supported version) |
| **Network Plugin** | Flannel 0.27.4 (or compatible) |

<Info>
  **For detailed information about software components:** [Overview - Components Required by Apinizer](/en/concepts/deployment/overview#components-required-by-apinizer)
</Info>

### Network Requirements

* **Internet Access**: Required during installation (special preparation required for offline installation)
* **DNS**: Working DNS resolution
* **Firewall**: Required ports must be open

<Info>
  **For detailed information about network topology and port requirements:** [Network Topology and Port Requirements](/en/concepts/deployment/network-topology)
</Info>

## 2. Hardware Requirements

The requirements below are specified for the recommended **minimum** configuration. They should be increased according to your service loads.

<Warning>
  **Apinizer does not recommend installing on a single server for production environments. Please evaluate such an installation configuration only for PoC environments.**
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Do not use Test/PoC installations for load testing purposes!** If you want to evaluate the correct configuration for load testing, please refer to our [Benchmark Results](/en/concepts/benchmark-results) page or contact us.
</Warning>

| No | Operating System | CPU | RAM | Disk | Installations |
|----|-----------------|-----|-----|------|------------|
| Server 1 | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS / RHEL 9.x | 8 | 32GB | 200GB | Kubernetes Control-Plane, Manager, Elasticsearch (Master+Data), Replica set MongoDB Single Instance |
| Server 2 | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS / RHEL 9.x | 4 | 4GB | 80GB | Kubernetes Worker |

<Info>
  **Important**: The CPU, disk, and RAM values above are given as examples. These values may vary according to traffic volume, number of APIs, policy complexity, and other factors. To determine your actual hardware requirements, it is recommended to calculate according to the rules on the [Capacity Planning](/en/concepts/deployment/capacity-planning) page.
</Info>

## 3. Network Topology

### Simple Network Structure

A simple network structure is sufficient for Test/PoC environments. DMZ/LAN separation is optional.

**Network Structure:**

* **Internet**: Traffic from the outside world is directed to the internal network through Firewall/Router (Port 443/80).
* **Server 1**: Hosts Kubernetes Control-Plane, [MongoDB](/en/concepts/core-concepts/connections), and [Elasticsearch](/en/concepts/core-components/analytics-engine) components.
* **Server 2**: Hosts Kubernetes Worker Node, [Manager](/en/concepts/core-components/api-manager), [Worker](/en/concepts/core-components/api-gateway), and Cache components.

This simple structure provides sufficient security and performance for test and PoC environments. More advanced network configurations (DMZ/LAN separation) are recommended for production environments.

<Info>
  **For detailed information about DMZ and LAN zones:** [Overview - Core Concepts](/en/concepts/deployment/overview#core-concepts) and [Network Topology and Port Requirements](/en/concepts/deployment/network-topology)
</Info>

### Port and Firewall Permissions

If all your servers will be located on the same subnet and there will be no firewall between them, firewall rules will only apply to internet access and container network communication. Since inter-server cluster and inter-component communication ports are considered directly accessible within the same subnet, there is no need to define an additional firewall rule for these communications.

<Info>
  **For detailed information about port requirements and firewall rules:** You can refer to the [Network Topology and Port Requirements](/en/concepts/deployment/network-topology) page. This page explains in detail all port requirements and firewall rules for Kubernetes, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Apinizer components.
</Info>

## 4. Capacity Planning

This topology is designed for **Tier 1** (Test/PoC) level low-traffic systems:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Daily Requests** | < 500,000 requests/day |
| **Requests per Second** | < 10 requests/second |
| **Peak Traffic** | < 50 requests/second |
| **Concurrent Users** | < 50 users |

<Info>
  **For detailed information about capacity planning:** You can refer to the [Capacity Planning](/en/concepts/deployment/capacity-planning) page. This page explains in detail traffic estimation, hardware requirements, MongoDB and Elasticsearch data size calculations, and benchmark performance results.
</Info>
