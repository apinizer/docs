## Data Protection Features

### Data Masking and Privacy

Apinizer provides comprehensive data masking and privacy features to protect sensitive data in API traffic:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Proxy Traffic Privacy Settings">
    To protect sensitive data in API traffic:
    
    * **Data Masking**: Masking of sensitive fields (e.g., hiding credit card numbers except the last 4 digits)
    * **Hashing**: One-way hashing for data protection (creating an irreversible value)
    * **Salt Usage**: Salt value for hashing (adding random data to increase hash security)
    * **Field-based Operations**: Element name and operation definitions (applying specific rules to certain JSON/XML fields)
    
    **Scanned Fields:**
    
    * Header, query parameter, and body of message from client
    * Header, query parameter, and body of message going to backend
    * Header and body of message returning from backend
    * Header and body of message returning to client
    
    <Tip>
    For detailed information, see the [API Proxy Traffic Privacy Settings](/en/develop/api-proxy-configuration/api-traffic-log-settings) page.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Protection">
    To protect personal information:
    
    * **Automatic Detection**: Automatic detection of personal information (name, surname, email, phone number, etc.)
    * **PII Masking Policies**: Personal information masking rules (automatic masking application to detected PII data)
    * **Data Minimization**: Collection of only necessary data (principle of data collection limited to purpose)
    * **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Filtering of sensitive data (filtering or blocking certain PII types from traffic)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Encryption">
    Encryption features for data security:
    
    * **Encryption at Rest**: Encryption in database (encryption of stored data)
    * **Encryption in Transit**: Encryption during transmission (communication security with TLS/SSL)
    * **Field-level Encryption**: Field-based encryption (encryption of certain sensitive fields)
    * **Key Management**: Encryption key management (secure creation, storage, and management of keys)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Hashing and Salt

When hashing method is used in API Proxy Traffic Privacy Settings:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hashing Features" icon="lock">
    * One-way hashing (converting data to an irreversible digest)
    * Irreversible (original data cannot be reached from hashed data)
    * Security enhancement with salt (ensures same data produces different hash values)
    * Secure data storage
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Salt Usage" icon="key">
    * Automatic salt generation by Apinizer (unique salt value generated for each hash operation)
    * Secret storage (salt values are stored securely)
    * Hashed data verification (used to verify the accuracy of hashed data)
    * Security enhancement
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**What is Salt?**

When hashing method is selected, data is hashed with an algorithm to be stored irreversibly. With salt, the output that would normally be created by selecting a hash algorithm is made different, preventing the hashed value from being found through comparison. This provides protection against "rainbow table" attacks by ensuring that users with the same password have different hash values.
</Info>
