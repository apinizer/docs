title: "API Designer"
description: "API Designer (API Designer), the component in the Apinizer platform that provides tools for API design, documentation, and specification with a spec first approach. It enables creating, editing OpenAPI/Swagger specifications and creating API Proxies from these specifications."

## API Designer Concept

API Designer supports the API development process with a **spec first** approach. In this approach, the OpenAPI/Swagger specification is created first, then the API Proxy is created from this specification.

## API Designer Usage Scenarios

API development scenarios with spec first approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Spec First API Development" icon="file-code">
    1. Creating OpenAPI/Swagger specification
    2. Defining endpoints and schemas
    3. Validating specification
    4. Creating API Proxy from specification
    5. Generating automatic documentation
    6. Publishing in API Portal
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Existing API Documentation" icon="book">
    1. Creating OpenAPI spec from existing API
    2. Editing and updating specification
    3. Improving documentation
    4. Adding examples and descriptions
    5. Publishing in Portal
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Designer and API Manager Relationship

API Designer works integrated with API Manager with spec first approach. Workflow:

```
API Designer
   │
   │ OpenAPI/Swagger Spec
   │ (Spec First)
   │
   ▼
API Manager
   │
   │ Creating API Proxy from Spec
   │ Configuration
   │
   ▼
API Gateway
```

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="1. Spec Creation" icon="file-code">
    OpenAPI/Swagger specification is created in API Designer
    
    API design starts with specification in spec first approach.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="2. Spec Validation" icon="check-circle">
    Specification is validated and checked
    
    Compliance check with OpenAPI standards is performed.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="3. API Proxy Creation" icon="network-wired">
    API Proxy is created from specification in API Manager
    
    API Proxy is automatically created from OpenAPI spec.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="4. Documentation and Deployment" icon="rocket">
    Documentation is generated and API is deployed
    
    Automatic documentation is produced and API is deployed to API Gateway.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
This integration between API Designer and API Manager provides a seamless process from API design to deployment with spec first approach. Specification is created first, then API Proxy and documentation are automatically generated from this specification.

  <Card title="Spec First Approach" icon="file-code">
    * API design starts with specification
    * Standard OpenAPI/Swagger format
    * API design without writing code
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Generation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    * Creating API Proxy from specification
    * Automatic documentation generation
    * Consistent API structure
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standard Compliance" icon="check-circle">
    * Compliance with OpenAPI/Swagger standards
    * Interoperability
    * Tool support
  </Card>
  <Card title="Up-to-Date Documentation" icon="book">
    * Automatic documentation from specification
    * Documentation-specification synchronization
    * Portal integration
  </Card>
