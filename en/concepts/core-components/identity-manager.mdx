## Identity Manager and API Gateway Relationship

Identity Manager supports authentication and authorization operations of API Gateway. Workflow:

```
API Consumer
   │
   │ Request (API Key / Token)
   ▼
API Gateway
   │
   │ Authentication Request
   ▼
Identity Manager
   │
   │ Validation Result
   ▼
API Gateway
   │
   │ Request Processing
   ▼
Backend API
```

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. Request" icon="arrow-right">
    API Consumer sends request with API Key or Token
    
    Request is routed to API Gateway.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="2. Validation" icon="key">
    API Gateway sends authentication request to Identity Manager
    
    Token or API Key is validated.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="3. Authorization" icon="lock">
    Identity Manager returns validation result and authorization information
    
    User permissions are checked.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="4. Processing" icon="cog">
    API Gateway processes request if validation is successful
    
    Policies are applied and routing is done.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="5. Response" icon="arrow-left">
    Response from Backend API is delivered to client
    
    All operations are logged.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
This integration between Identity Manager and API Gateway provides central identity management and secure API access.

## Identity Provider Integration

Identity Manager can obtain user information from different sources (Identity Provider) for authentication. In addition to Apinizer's own embedded identity provider, the following sources can be used:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Database Connection" icon="database">
    User validation by connecting to databases
    
    * Connecting to databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL
    * Querying user information from database
    * Password validation and obtaining user information
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Call" icon="code">
    Authentication via REST API
    
    * Calling REST APIs of external identity providers
    * Token-based authentication
    * Integration with custom authentication services
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="LDAP/Active Directory" icon="server">
    LDAP and Active Directory integration
    
    * Connecting to LDAP servers
    * Integration with Active Directory
    * Obtaining user and group information from LDAP
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database Identity Provider">
    Authentication via database connection:
    
    * **Database Connection**: Connecting to database through Connection management
    * **User Query**: Obtaining user information with SQL queries
    * **Password Validation**: Comparing with password in database
    * **User Information**: Obtaining user profile information
    
    <Tip>
    When database identity provider is used, user information is dynamically retrieved from the database and there is no need for Apinizer's own user database.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Call Identity Provider">
    Authentication via REST API:
    
    * **API Endpoint**: REST API endpoint of external identity provider
    * **Request Format**: Request format and parameters
    * **Response Parsing**: Response format and extracting user information
    * **Error Handling**: Managing error situations
    
    <Tip>
    Thanks to API Call identity provider, integration can be done with any REST API-based identity provider.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="LDAP/Active Directory Identity Provider">
    LDAP and Active Directory integration:
    
    * **LDAP Connection**: Connecting to LDAP server
    * **User Search**: Searching and validating users in LDAP
    * **Group Information**: Obtaining user's group memberships
    * **Active Directory**: Integration with Windows Active Directory
    
    <Tip>
    When LDAP identity provider is used, direct integration with enterprise user databases is provided.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Identity Manager provides a flexible identity management solution by supporting different identity providers. This facilitates integration with existing enterprise identity systems.
