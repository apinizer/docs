description: "API Manager (API Administrator), the main component in the Control Plane (Management Plane) layer of the Apinizer platform that provides all management, configuration, and monitoring functions of the platform. It is the central management component of the Apinizer platform and manages the configuration of API Gateways (Data Plane)."

## API Manager Concept

API Manager is the central management component of the Apinizer platform. It manages the configuration of API Gateways (Data Plane), controls the API lifecycle, and provides monitoring and analytics across the platform.

## API Manager Components

API Manager consists of the following components:

### Web Interface

API Manager provides a web-based management interface. All configurations are made through this interface:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Proxy Management">
    * Creating, editing, and deleting API Proxies
    * API Proxy configuration
    * Policy management
    * Routing configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Project and Environment Management">
    * Creating and managing projects
    * Environment management
    * Deployment management
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User and Role Management">
    * User management
    * Role definition
    * ACL (Access Control List) management
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection Management">
    * Database connections
    * LDAP connections
    * HTTP connections
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Management API

RESTful API for programmatic access. All management operations can also be performed through this API:

  <Card title="RESTful API" icon="code">
    Standard REST API endpoints
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authentication" icon="key">
    OAuth2, JWT, Basic Auth support
  </Card>
  <Card title="OpenAPI Spec" icon="file-code">
    OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Management API Usage Scenarios:**
* CI/CD pipeline integration
* Automatic deployment
* Bulk configuration management
* Custom tool development

### Test Console

Development environment tools for testing APIs:

* **Request Builder**: Creating and sending requests
* **Response Viewer**: Viewing and analyzing responses
* **Policy Testing**: Testing policies
* **Debug Mode**: Debugging mode

## API Manager Features

### Configuration Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Central Configuration">
    * All API Proxy configurations are managed from a single center
    * Configuration versioning
    * Configuration rollback
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deployment Management">
    * Environment-based deployment
    * Automatic deployment
    * Deployment history
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Template Management">
    * Policy templates
    * Reusable configurations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Lifecycle Management

API lifecycle management:

```
Design → Development → Test → Production → Deprecation → Retirement
```

  <Card title="Versioning" icon="code-branch">
    API versioning and management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deployment" icon="rocket">
    Environment-based deployment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deprecation" icon="clock">
    API deprecation management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Monitoring and Analytics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Real-Time Monitoring" icon="eye">
    * API traffic monitoring
    * Performance metrics
    * Error rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analytics" icon="chart-bar">
    * Usage statistics
    * Trend analysis
    * Reporting
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Manager and API Gateway Relationship

API Manager manages the configuration of API Gateways (Data Plane):

```
API Manager (Control Plane)
   │
   │ Configuration Management
   │ Deployment
   │ Monitoring
   │
   ▼
API Gateway (Data Plane)
   │
   │ API Traffic Processing
   │ Policy Enforcement
   │ Routing
```

**Workflow:**
1. Configuration is done in API Manager
2. Configuration is deployed to API Gateways
3. API Gateways process traffic using the configuration
4. API Gateways send metrics to API Manager

## API Manager Usage Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Development">
    * Creating and configuring API Proxies
    * Defining and applying policies
    * Testing and debugging
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Management">
    * API versioning
    * Deployment management
    * User and access management
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitoring and Analytics">
    * API performance monitoring
    * Usage analysis
    * Error detection and resolution
  </Accordion>
