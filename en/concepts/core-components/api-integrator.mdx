title: "API Integrator"
description: "API Integrator (API Integrator), the component in the Apinizer platform that meets integration requirements without writing code and automates them, exposing them as APIs or web services. It is also called Task Flow Manager and is a workflow management system that can automatically execute multiple tasks in a specific order. It performs integration operations between different systems using Task Flows (Task Flows). Integration scenarios can be created with a visual interface and provides support for 15+ different connectors."
