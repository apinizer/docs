title: "Monitoring Component"
description: "Monitoring Component (Monitoring Component), the component in the Apinizer platform that provides system health monitoring, anomaly detection, and alarm management functions. It monitors the uptime status of API Proxies at specified time intervals with Uptime Monitor. It detects anomalies that exceed threshold values by analyzing time-based data in log records with Anomaly Detector. It produces and manages alarms for various system components such as Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, SSL/JWK certificate expiration, API traffic logs, and application logs."

### Anomaly Detector

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Condition Types">
    Four different condition types can be used for anomaly detection:
    
    * **Threshold Value Check**: Anomaly detection when metric values exceed determined threshold value
    * **EMA with Bollinger Bands**: Anomaly detection using Exponential Moving Average and Bollinger Bands
    * **Query/Filter Ratio Check**: Anomaly detection based on ratio of query and filter results
    * **Custom Conditions**: User-defined complex conditions
    
    <Tip>
    Anomaly Detector detects unexpected behaviors by analyzing API traffic logs and produces alarms.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Configuration">
    * Defining queries and filters
    * Determining conditions
    * Time range and triggering frequency
    * Defining actions when anomaly is detected
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For detailed information about Anomaly Detector, see the [Anomaly Detector](/en/monitor/anomaly-detector) page.
</Tip>

### Alarm Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Alarm Types">
    The following alarm types are available in Apinizer:
    
    * **Kubernetes Pod Health Status**: Health status of Kubernetes pods
    * **Kubernetes Node Health Status**: Health status of Kubernetes nodes
    * **Kubernetes Node CPU Percentage**: Kubernetes node CPU usage percentage
    * **Elasticsearch Health Status**: Elasticsearch cluster health status
    * **Elasticsearch CPU Percentage**: Elasticsearch CPU usage percentage
    * **Elasticsearch Disk Percentage**: Elasticsearch disk usage percentage
    * **API Traffic Logs Exist in Database**: Existence of API traffic logs in database
