## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, make sure the following requirements are met:

* Kubernetes cluster is ready and accessible
* Helm is installed in your environment
* MongoDB application is installed

<Note>
  If Helm is not installed, you can review the [Helm Installation Document](/en/setup/helm/apinizer) page.
</Note>

## 1) Adding Repository

Add apinizer chart repo to Helm.

```bash
helm repo add apinizer-charts https://apinizer1.github.io/apinizer-charts
helm repo update
```

## 2) Apinizer Installation

You can perform Apinizer installation without any special settings by running the following command:

```bash
helm install apinizer-charts apinizer-charts/apinizer
```
