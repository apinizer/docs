title: "Mongo"
description: "You can install MongoDB on Kubernetes environment using Helm. MongoDB installation can be done to meet Apinizer's data storage needs and can be easily managed through Helm chart repository."
---

<Warning>
  This installation method is **not recommended for production environments.**

  MongoDB is installed as only a single replica and data is stored on the first suitable worker node that does not have control-plane role using hostPath.

  If there is only one node in the cluster, the control-plane label and taint on the node must be removed with the following commands so that the pod can run on this node:

  ```bash
  kubectl label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-
  kubectl taint nodes <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
  ```

  It is recommended to use NFS, Ceph, Longhorn or a cloud-based storage solution so that data can be stored independently of nodes.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, make sure the following requirements are met:

* Kubernetes cluster is ready and accessible
* Helm is installed in your environment

<Note>
  If Helm is not installed, you can review the [Helm Installation Document](/en/setup/helm/apinizer.mdx) page.
</Note>

## 1) Adding Repository

```bash
helm repo add mongodb-charts https://apinizer1.github.io/mongodb-charts
helm repo update
```

## 2) Mongo Installation

You can perform MongoDB installation without any special settings by running the following command:

```bash
helm install mongodb-charts mongodb-charts/mongo
```

<Info>
  **Note:** Version `mongo:8.0` is used in the current installation. If you want to prefer a more up-to-date version, you can use version `mongo:8.0`. You can review all Mongodb versions on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/tags).
</Info>

## Optional Parameters

| Option | Default Value | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `image.mongo` | `mongo:8.0` | Specifies the version of MongoDB image. |

If you want to use a different MongoDB version, you can specify the version by adding the optional parameter as in the example below in your Helm installation command:

```bash
helm install mongo-charts mongo-charts/mongo --set image.mongo=mongo:latest
```

## 3) Installation Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **TZ (Time Zone)** | Europe/Istanbul – Set with TZ environment variable inside the container. Thus, application and MongoDB logs work according to Turkey time. |
| **Database** | `apinizerdb` |
| **Username** | `kubectl get secret -n mongo mongodb-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME}" | base64 --decode; echo` |
| **Password** | `kubectl get secret -n mongo mongodb-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode; echo` |
| **Port** | `25080` |
| **Data directory** | `/mnt/data` this directory is mapped with the path on your host machine (hostPath). Thus, data is kept on the host and is persistent. |
