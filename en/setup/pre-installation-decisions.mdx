## Installation and Infrastructure Decisions

### Kubernetes and MongoDB Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will applications such as Kubernetes Cluster and MongoDB that Apinizer needs be installed or are they already available and will be used?">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
      <Card title="Our Recommendations">
        * Using these components if they are already available in your organization
        * Preparing them by your team if installation will be done
        * Having installation done by the Apinizer team if installation will be done
        * If installation will be done by the Apinizer team, the relevant servers must have access to the accesses in the [Access and Port Requirements for Installation](/en/setup/access-and-port-requirements) page
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If installation will be done, will your organization's employees do it or will servers be allocated to the Apinizer team?">
    This decision determines who will manage the installation process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If installation will be done by the Apinizer team, will internet access on the servers be restricted or full?">
    Internet access status affects the installation method (online/offline).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Network and Security Decisions

### Network Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a product other than WAF and firewall that controls the network where Apinizer will be installed and performs security hardening?">
    <Info>
      Since such a product can also block internal traffic of the cluster where Apinizer is located, it is important to report this if such a product exists, as it will speed up the search for solutions in possible problems. This information can be obtained from your organization's Network and Security Unit employees.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a usage in the 10.244.x.x block in the network where Apinizer will be installed?">
    <Warning>
      If it is used, this information should be obtained from your organization's network team, as Apinizer installation will need to be installed on another block.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Port and DNS Decisions

### Port Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which ports should Apinizer publish on the servers where it is located?">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
      <Card title="Our Recommendations">
        * From the 30000-32767 range, 32080 for Manager, 30080 or 30090 for worker
        * At ports to be set under the management of your organization's DevOps Team (again from the same range or using nginx ingress)
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will the DNSs that Apinizer will access be automatically resolved on the servers where Apinizer will be located? If not, are these IP-host definitions ready as available?">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
      <Card title="Our Recommendations">
        * Setting servers to automatically resolve these addresses, as they can change even very rarely
        * Preparing hostname-IP pairs as a list to be added to Apinizer
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will Apinizer interface and workers be used via DNS? If yes, what will the DNSs be?">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
      <Card title="Our Recommendations">
