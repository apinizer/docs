## Home Page Settings

This area is the section where the content that users first encounter on the API Portal homepage is edited. Portal introduction texts, guiding descriptions, links, or visual content are defined in this tab.

During editing, a "Preview" section appears on the right side; this way, how the changes made will appear on the portal can be monitored instantly.

The content editing area is located on the left side, and HTML or plain text can be added here.

A welcome message, description, or guide text compatible with the portal's corporate identity can be created in this area.

Home Page offers two language support:

- **Portal Home (EN):** English content area
- **Portal Home (TR):** Turkish content area

If both language options are active on the Portal Settings screen, the system automatically shows the user the content in the appropriate language.

### Impact on API Portal Interface

By default, the homepage comes as shown in the attached image:

<img
  src="/images/portal/ana_sayfa_gorunumu.png"
  alt="Home Page Portal View"
  width="800"
  className="mr-auto"
/>

When default content is entered, the portal homepage opens to the user with a welcome header, short description, and action cards such as "How It Works?", "Discover Our APIs", "Register", "Contact Us". In the attached screenshot (example), how the homepage cards are aligned can be seen.

After saving your own HTML and refreshing the portal page, you can see the same area live. If you used a column structure in HTML, cards or banners take their place in this area.

## How It Works

This area is used to manage the content of the "How It Works" page on the API Portal. It is the section where informative content such as the general operation of the system, API access process, or registration/step-by-step usage guide is presented to portal users.

The content editing area is on the left, and the **"Preview"** area showing how the changes made will appear on the portal is on the right.

Content can be prepared in HTML format; rich text elements such as headings, lists, or links are supported.

How It Works offers two language options:

- **How It Works (EN):** English content area
- **How It Works (TR):** Turkish content area

When both language options are active in the Portal Settings section, the "How It Works" page in the relevant language is automatically shown to the user.

This page is generally prepared to enhance user experience and explain the portal's usage.

<img
  src="/images/portal/nasil_calisir_ayarlari.png"
  alt="How It Works Settings"
  width="800"
  className="mr-auto"
/>

### Impact on API Portal Interface

**The image containing the view of the example screen on the API Portal is provided below:**

<img
  src="/images/portal/nasil_calisir_portal.png"
  alt="How It Works Portal View"
  width="800"
  className="mr-auto"
/>

The How It Works HTML area uses the same HTML editor. If you support multiple languages, fill in both tabs. You can add step-by-step guides, icons, numbered lists to the content.

Menu path: Portal top menu → How It Works?

Content is rendered as HTML, "Home / How It Works?" appears in the breadcrumb.

Language control: Currently the component uses English content (howItWorksHtml); if you want to add TR support, you need to extend the component.

## Footer Settings

This section is the area where the content to be displayed at the bottom (footer) of the API Portal is edited. Generally, contact information, legal texts, copyright statements, or corporate links are located here.

HTML or plain text can be added to the text area on the left; this way, links, logos, or short information texts can be displayed in formatted form.

The "Preview" area on the right enables instant viewing of how the changes made will appear at the bottom of the portal.

Footer offers two language support:

- **Footer (EN):** English content area
- **Footer (TR):** Turkish content area

If both TR and EN languages are active on the Portal Settings screen, the footer area in the user's preferred language is automatically shown to the user.

This way, the bottom of the portal can also be arranged in a multilingual, corporate structure.

<img
  src="/images/portal/footer_ayarlari.png"
  alt="Footer Settings"
  width="800"
  className="mr-auto"
/>

### Impact on API Portal Interface

**The image containing the view of the example screen on the API Portal is provided below:**

<img
  src="/images/portal/footer_portal.png"
  alt="Footer Portal View"
  width="800"
  className="mr-auto"
/>

The Footer HTML area is the HTML that appears in the portal's bottom section.

You can add social media icons, contact information, legal texts.

If embeds containing scripts (e.g., live chat) are needed, you can use `<script>` within HTML; the component is designed to execute these scripts.

Working logic:

- HTML content is made safe with DomSanitizer.
- If there is `<script>` in the content, the executeScripts() function runs and adds scripts to the DOM.
- When the setting changes, the footer is immediately updated (page refresh is sufficient).

## Saving and Preview

### Saving Process

**How to Save:**

- Click the "Save" button in the top right corner
- All tabs (Basic, Home Page, How It Works, Footer) are saved at the same time
- After successful save, changes are reflected on the portal instantly.

**Preview:**
