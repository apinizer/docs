### How Does Data Flow Work in Portal Application?

**Manager → Portal Synchronization (User Perspective)**

<Steps>
<Step title="Save in Manager">
The moment you create and save the FAQ record leaving it `Active`, the information is written to the central database.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Portal Page">
When a portal user enters the `FAQ` menu, the screen automatically loads all active questions registered at that moment.
</Step>

<Step title="Categories Automatically Created">
Category names you provided in Manager appear as top tabs on the portal; users see only questions belonging to the category they click.
</Step>

<Step title="Instant Update">
When you deactivate a question or change its answer in Manager, the new content is immediately reflected when the portal page is refreshed. No additional publishing step is needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Language Compatibility">
Don't forget to add separate records for each language in multi-language portals. When the portal language is changed, questions in that language are shown; other languages are hidden.
</Step>
</Steps>
