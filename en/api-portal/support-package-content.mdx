Features defined on the Support Package Content page (24/7 Support, Code Support, Phone Support, etc.) are presented as a selection list in the "Support Packages" section when creating a new support package. You can customize your package by selecting multiple features according to your needs. You can review the [Support Packages](/en/api-portal/support-packages) document for the usage of the Support Packages page.

Defined contents are listed on the **Support Packages** page and one or more contents can be added to created support packages. A sample screenshot is shown below.
