## Portal and Manager Relationship

API Developer Portal works closely integrated with Apinizer API Manager:

- **API Manager**: Where API Proxies are created, configured, and deployed
- **API Portal**: Where APIs published in API Manager are offered to developers
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Portal reads API information from Manager; changes made in Manager are automatically reflected in Portal
- **Publishing**: When API Products are published in Manager, they become visible on Portal

## Important Notes

<Info>
- For Portal to work, API Proxies must be created and deployed in API Manager
- If Elasticsearch integration is done from portal settings, analytics features can be used
- Self-service registration feature must be enabled from portal settings
- Both language options must be active for multi-language support
</Info>

<Warning>
- Changes made on Portal (API Product contents, plans, documentation) must be made through API Manager
- Portal users can only manage their own applications and subscriptions
- API Keys are shown once and cannot be viewed again; they must be stored securely
</Warning>
