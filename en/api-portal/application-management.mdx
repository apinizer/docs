## My Applications in API Portal Interface

On API Portal, users can only see and manage their own applications.

## Creating Application from Portal

  width="900"
  className="mr-auto"
/>

<img

  alt="Application List on Portal"
  width="900"
  className="mr-auto"
/>
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scenario A: User with No Applications">
    **Step 1:** When the My Applications page opens and an empty list card and "You don't have any applications yet" message appears:
    * Click the **"+ Create"** button
    * Fill in the information in the opened dialog

    **Step 2:**
    * Click the **"Save"** button
    * When registration is completed, your first automatically created application is added to the list and your first API Key is prepared
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Scenario B: User with Existing Applications">
    **Step 1:** When existing applications are listed in card/table on the list page:
    * The **"+ Create"** button in the top right corner is always visible
    * New application can be added by clicking this button

    **Step 2:**
    * App and plan are selected and registration is made
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
For the steps to be taken according to the API Product's status after the registration process is completed, it is explained in detail in the [API Product Access Settings](/en/api-portal/approval-requests#api-product-access-settings) section on the Approval Requests page.
</Info>

Another method of creating an application on the API Portal interface is to perform operations through the **"My Applications"** page. This page is the central area where all management steps such as creating new applications, editing or deleting existing applications are performed.

On the API Product detail screen, only **adding an existing application to the relevant API Product** is possible; application editing or deletion operations are not performed here.

Additionally; when creating an application on the API Manager side, the **Account / Developer** section must be entered. However, since the user is already logged in with verified identity on the Portal side, applications created through Portal are **automatically saved as belonging to the relevant user**.

Below, the interface of the Portal My Applications page is shown as an example.
