</Steps>

### Scenario 2: User Segmentation and Traffic Analysis

To analyze the source distribution of portal traffic and perform user segmentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter by Account Name">
    Filter or group the table by Account Name column:
    
    **Public (Anonymous) Traffic:**
    - Examine records where Account Name = "Public"
    - Calculate total Public view count
    
    **Registered User Traffic:**
    - Examine records where Account Name = Email address
    - Calculate total registered user view count
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Traffic Ratio">
    Calculate the ratio of both traffic types:
    
    **Example Calculation:**
    - Total views: 10,000
    - Public views: 7,000 (70%)
    - Registered user views: 3,000 (30%)
    
    **Interpretation:**
    - If Public traffic is high: Portal promotion is good, but registration rate may be low
    - If registered user traffic is high: Existing developers are active
  </Step>
  <Step title="Segment-Based Analysis">
    Perform separate analysis for each segment:
