## Usage of Created Categories

Can be selected from the "Category" field in API Product creation or editing screen.
An API Product is classified to belong to one of the defined categories.
This way:

* API Developer Portal users can easily find APIs by filtering them by specific categories.
* Organization administrators can report APIs by topical or functional areas.
* Category-based statistics, access counts, or subscription distributions on the Portal become more meaningful.

For example:

* APIs under Education category: Can include services for educational institutions or certification systems.
* APIs under Finance category: Can cover financial operations such as banking, payment, accounting.
* Store category: Can group APIs related to e-commerce or inventory management.

    height="600"
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}

* **Instant Update:** When category name, description, or API relationship is changed in Manager, the new structure is immediately visible when the portal page is refreshed; no additional deploy/publish step is needed.
* **Multi-Language Support:** If you change the portal language, category headers in the left menu are shown with their translations. For multi-language portals, make sure you fill each language field in Manager.

### How Does Data Flow Work in Portal Application?

**Manager → Portal Synchronization**

<Steps>
<Step title="When Portal User Opens Catalog">
When the `APIs` page is opened on API Portal, the catalog component in the portal application runs and starts requesting current category information.
</Step>

<Step title="Fetches Categories and APIs">
The component calls services that provide active categories in Manager and API products linked to these categories. This way, all current data you saved is transferred to the portal side.
</Step>

<Step title="Left Menu is Constructed">
The tree structure on the left (category → API names) is automatically created using the incoming category list. The hierarchy in Manager is reflected one-to-one on the screen.
</Step>

<Step title="Cards are Updated">
API cards belonging to the selected category are shown on the right; information on cards (logo, description, Active label, protocol) is automatically retrieved from API product records.
</Step>

<Step title="Refresh Cycle">
Every change you make in category or API relationship in Manager is displayed with the new service response when the portal page is opened again or refreshed; no additional publishing step is needed.
</Step>
</Steps>
