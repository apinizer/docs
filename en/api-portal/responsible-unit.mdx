When creating an API Product, which unit will manage the relevant product is selected from this field. This way, API Developer Portal users can easily see which unit they need to contact when they want to get information about the API or request support.

The API Product Responsible Units screen is a corporate management tool that helps you define teams or people responsible for managing your API products and associate these responsible parties with API products. You can centrally record operation, support, development, or business unit responsible parties for each API product, send notifications to these teams when needed, and make them visible in reports.
