title: "Approval Requests"
description: "Manages access requests to API products and new memberships on the Portal interface. You can view, approve, or reject API Product Application Registration and Account/Developer requests. By default, requests are automatically approved; you can configure API Product Access Settings and Approval Requests to include them in the manual approval process."

## API Product Access Settings

Users do not directly access APIs; they first create an application and request access to the API product through this application.

API products are configured as public by default. In this case, when a user requests access to an API through their application, the request is automatically approved and the user immediately gains access.

However, the product owner can change the **"Access requests from applications"** setting found for each product on the **Apinizer API Manager > Administration > Portal > API Products** page with **configure**. This setting is shown in the image below:

<Info>
This setting is configured per product and each API product can be managed independently. A change in one product does not affect other products.
</Info>

/>

* **When option is checked:** Access requests from applications are automatically approved (default state).
* **When option is unchecked:** Users cannot automatically gain access. In this case, the user requests access through their application and must wait for the product owner's manual approval.

This setting allows the product owner to manage who can access the API product in a controlled manner.

## Usage in Portal Interface

After automatic application approval is turned off and saved, it can be tested from Portal as follows.

On the API Portal Screen, APIs are selected and the relevant product is opened, and the following operations are applied.

## Automatic Approval Setting

API Portal is configured as automatic approval by default. To manage this process, the following steps are applied.

The approval process for users who want to become new members of the Portal is controlled by the **"Auto Approve Account/Developers"** setting in **Apinizer API Manager > Administration > Portal > Settings > Portal > Security** tab.

If this setting is on, the account can be logged in directly with email verification without admin verification.

If this setting is off, the email address is first verified, then the registration request comes to the **Apinizer API Manager > Administration > Approval Requests > Account/Developer** screen.
