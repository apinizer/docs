## What is Multi Portal?

**API Developer Multi Portal** feature allows you to create and manage multiple independent API Developer Portals on the Apinizer platform. Each portal works as a completely independent environment with its own users, APIs, settings, and appearance.

### Simple Explanation with Examples

Imagine you are a company serving different groups:

**Scenario 1: Different Departments**
- **Sales Team Portal:** Special APIs and documentation for your sales team
- **Customer Service Portal:** Different APIs for your customer service team
- **IT Department Portal:** Advanced APIs for technical team

**Scenario 2: Different Customer Groups**
- **Partner Companies Portal:** Special APIs for your business partners
- **General User Portal:** Public APIs
- **Premium Customer Portal:** Premium APIs for your special customers

**Scenario 3: Different Environments**
- **Test Portal:** For development and testing
- **Production Portal:** For live system
- **Demo Portal:** For demonstrations and demos

Each portal is like a separate website working on its own. Changes you make in one do not affect others.

### How Does Multi Portal Work?

**Single Platform, Multiple Portals**

On the Apinizer platform, you can manage all your portals from a single management panel:

1. **Portal Creation:** When you create a new portal, the system automatically:
   - Creates a unique URL for the portal
   - Allocates a separate database area
   - Prepares an independent working environment

2. **Portal Management:** For each portal:
   - You can configure its own settings
   - You can add its own users
   - You can publish its own APIs
   - You can customize its own appearance

3. **Portal Access:** Each portal:
   - Has its own URL (e.g., `https://api.company.com/portal/partner-portal`)
   - Has its own login page
   - Has its own user accounts

### Portal Isolation

Each portal works in a completely isolated structure technically:

| Component | Description |
|---------|----------|
| **Namespace** | Each portal works in its own namespace, separate from other portals |
| **Pod** | Each portal works in its own working unit (pod) |
| **Secret** | Each portal has its own security keys and passwords |
| **Service** | Each portal has its own service configuration |

Thanks to this isolation:
- A problem occurring in one portal does not affect others
- Security vulnerabilities do not spread from one portal to another
- Performance issues remain isolated

### Independent Configuration

All settings and configurations of each portal are independent from each other:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Appearance and Theme Settings" icon="palette">
    Different for each portal:
    - Logo and brand image
    - Color scheme (primary color, secondary color, background)

### Summary

**Multi Portal** allows you to create and manage multiple independent API Developer Portals on the Apinizer platform. Each portal:

✅ Has its own users  
✅ Publishes its own APIs  
✅ Has its own appearance  
✅ Has its own settings  
✅ Works completely independently  

This way, you can offer customized portal experiences for different customer groups, departments, or environments, and manage each one independently.
