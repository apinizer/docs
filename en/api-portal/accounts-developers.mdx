On the Apinizer portal, creating and managing API access tokens is quite simple. API tokens allow your application to access Apinizer APIs.

* Allows you to generate bearer tokens for machine-to-machine calls on behalf of the API Portal account (CLI, automation, third-party integration).
* Each token is saved with name and duration information; you can cancel it whenever you want.

## Where Are Tokens Used?

**API Access Token** is an authentication tool used to securely access the Apinizer API.

The "API Access Tokens" tab on the profile page allows developers to generate personal access keys to authorize machine-to-machine integrations connected to their own account. These keys are specifically designed for AI assistants working via MCP (Model Context Protocol) or external automations to access Portal/Manager APIs; tokens generated on the service side come in **mcp_\<uuid\>** format and are only shown as plain text at the moment of creation.

This token allows your application or integrations to send or receive data to/from the Apinizer API over different platforms.

By integrating the token you created with platforms such as **API Portal** and **AI tools using MCP**, you can securely manage data flow between systems.

* For MCP integration, you can visit the [API Portal MCP Usage](/en/api-portal/mcp-usage/mcp-overview) documentation.

## Creating Account from API Portal Interface

Anyone who wants to access the Apinizer API Portal, including Apinizer administrators, must register with the relevant API Portal and request access. Administrators will have separate credentials for Apinizer and the API Developer Portal.

Developer registrations can be manually approved by Apinizer administrators or automatically approved by configuring automatic approval settings.
