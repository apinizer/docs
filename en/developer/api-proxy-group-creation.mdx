API Proxy Groups allow multiple API Proxies to be managed as a group. Policies added to the API Proxy Group and applied settings are executed when requests arrive at the API Proxy Group and are forwarded to the API Proxies in the group.

:::info Version 2024.05.1 Patch Update
Starting with version 2024.05.1 Patch:
- An API Proxy can be in multiple API Proxy Groups.
- The feature of managing API Proxies that need common policies with API Proxy Groups has been removed.
- If you need to use common policies, you can use global policies or policy groups.
:::

## API Proxy Group List

When the API Proxy Group list is first opened, existing API Proxy Groups are listed.

## Creating an API Proxy Group

To create a new API Proxy Group, click the **+Create** (New) button in the top right corner of the API Proxy Group List interface.

**API Proxy Group creation screen:**

The following table describes the fields used in the API Proxy Group creation interface:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A unique name for the API Proxy Group. Spaces and special characters should not be used, and a meaningful name should be chosen for group identification. |
| **Description** | An optional text field describing the purpose and usage scenario of the API Proxy Group. Used to understand the group's function during management and maintenance processes. |
| **Client Route** | Routing information that clients will use to access this API Proxy Group. At least one of the path, method, or header-based routing options must be selected.<br/><br/>**Relative Paths:** Relative URL paths that will be routed to the API Proxy Group. Multiple paths can be defined, each path must start with "/".<br/><br/>**Methods:** HTTP methods allowed for this group (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD). By default, all methods can be selected.<br/><br/>**Hosts:** Host addresses of backend services. Multiple hosts can be added.<br/><br/>**Headers:** HTTP headers to be added or modified at the API Proxy Group level. Defined as key-value pairs, applied to all requests belonging to this group.<br/><br/>For detailed information, see: [HTTP Routing](/en/developer/http-routing) |

After saving, the API Proxy Group configuration interface opens.

## Configuring the API Proxy Group

The configuration of the **Overview**, **Settings**, and **Development** tabs is exactly the same as those of API Proxy, with a few minor differences.

### Overview Tab

**Overview Tab:**

The following table describes the fields used in the Overview Tab configuration:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The name of the API Proxy Group. This is a required field. |
| **Description** | Description/definition information about the API Proxy Group. Optional. |
| **Client Route** | Routing information that clients will use to access the API Proxy Group. For detailed information, see: [HTTP Routing](/en/developer/http-routing) |
| **API Proxy Group Key** | Section where Public and Secret Keys required for JWT or OAuth2 authorization through the API Proxy Group are managed. For detailed information, see how these keys are managed for [API Proxy](/en/developer/api-proxy-configuration/overview). |

### Settings Tab

**Settings Tab:**

The Settings tab contains general settings for the API Proxy Group. These settings are applied at the group level and affect all API Proxies in the group.

### Development Tab

**Development Tab:**

The Development tab allows you to manage policies for the API Proxy Group. Policies defined at the group level are applied to all API Proxies in the group.

## Adding API Proxies to API Proxy Group

To add API Proxies to an API Proxy Group:

1. Go to the API Proxy Group detail page
2. Click on the **API Proxies** tab
3. Click the **Add API Proxy** button
4. Select the API Proxies you want to add
5. Click the **Save** button

### API Proxy Selection

During API Proxy selection:

* All existing API Proxies are listed
* You can select multiple API Proxies
* An API Proxy can be in multiple groups

## API Proxy Group Policies

Policies defined at the API Proxy Group level:

* **Pre-flow Policies**: Pre-request group policies
* **Post-flow Policies**: Post-response group policies
* **Fault Handler Policies**: Error handling group policies

### Policy Priority

Policy priority order:

1. API Proxy level policies (highest priority)
2. API Proxy Group level policies
3. Global policies (lowest priority)

## API Proxy Group Deployment

To deploy an API Proxy Group:

1. Go to the API Proxy Group detail page
2. Click the **Deploy** button
3. Select the target environment
4. Confirm the deployment

### Deployment Features

* All API Proxies in the group are deployed
* Group level policies are applied
* Client Route settings become active

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Microservice Groups

Managing related microservices under a group:

* Product Service Group
* Order Service Group
* Payment Service Group

### Scenario 2: Version Groups

Managing different API versions as groups:

* API v1 Group
* API v2 Group

### Scenario 3: Customer Groups

Customer-based API groups:

* Customer A APIs
* Customer B APIs

## Best Practices

### Group Naming

* **Meaningful Names**: Keep group names descriptive and meaningful
* **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming conventions
* **Short and Clear**: Keep names short and clear

### Group Structure

* **Logical Grouping**: Group related API Proxies logically
* **Group Size**: Don't make groups too large (recommended: 5-15 API Proxies)
* **Hierarchy**: Use hierarchical group structure if necessary

### Policy Management

* **Group Policies**: Define common policies at group level
* **API Proxy Policies**: Define specific policies at API Proxy level
* **Policy Priority**: Consider policy priority order
