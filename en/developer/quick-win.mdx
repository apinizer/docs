# Quick Start

This section explains how to quickly create an API Proxy and make it accessible. By following the steps below, you can create your own API Proxy.

:::tip Try It Out
You can try out the steps described here in the demo environment at [https://demo.apinizer.com/](https://demo.apinizer.com/). If you haven't created an account yet, [click here](https://demo.apinizer.com/register) to create a user account in the demo environment.
:::

When you create an account in the demo environment, Apinizer automatically creates a default Project for you. All your operations are isolated within this Project and cannot be viewed or modified by other users.

:::note Example Setup
In this example, we use REST API as the API type and a Swagger file as the definition file. Other options can be selected if desired.

## Creating an API Proxy

Follow these steps to create your first API Proxy:

1. Go to [https://demo.apinizer.com/](https://demo.apinizer.com/) and log in.

2. In the popup window that appears, select the Project that was created for you.

3. In the main menu on the left, select **Development → API Proxies**.

4. In the interface that opens, click the **+Create** button in the top right corner.

5. In the new API Proxy creation interface, click the **Enter URL** link for Swagger 2.x.

6. In the interface that appears, enter the URL `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` in the **URL** text box and click the **Parse** button on the right.

7. The Swagger file at the given address is parsed and the API information is displayed.

   In the interface that appears:
   - In the **Address** section, check the box for `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2`
   - Enter `/petstoreProxy` in the **Relative Path** field
   - Click the save button in the top right

   :::info Relative Path
   The `petstoreProxy` address added as the **Relative Path** is the virtual access point given to access the API through Apinizer.
   :::

**That's it! The API Proxy creation is complete.**

## Deploying the API Proxy

Once an API Proxy is created, several tabs appear in the interface. The configurations made in these tabs customize the behavior of the API Proxy. The API Proxy must be deployed to be accessible.

1. Go to the **Develop** tab.

2. In the **Develop** tab, the API Proxy's endpoints are visible on the left, and policies and flow are visible in the middle section. Various links or buttons open interfaces related to configurations.

3. Click the **Deploy** button in the middle top. Active environment options (1 Prod in the demo environment) will appear. Select the appropriate one. An optional deployment reason entry window appears; filling it is not mandatory. Click the **Deploy** button to continue.

**The API Proxy has been deployed and is ready for access.**

## Accessing the API Proxy

Once the API Proxy is deployed, the access address appears in the interface. The API Proxy is now an API for clients (API Consumers) who want to access it and is accessible from this address.

There are many methods to send a request to an API. In this example, we will use the interface provided by the platform for simplicity.

1. From the left, select the endpoint/method you want to access. New links appear in the middle bottom section, and the access address is updated to show the selected endpoint's address. Click the **Test Endpoint** link.

2. In the popup window that opens, you can see which HTTP Method the endpoint expects, the access address, and below them, tabs for parameters (default), headers, body, validation rules, or advanced settings that can be managed for the endpoint.

3. Enter `pending` in the **status** parameter value. You can see that the **URL** information changes with the value you enter here. Click the **Send** button.

4. Tabs appear containing the response returned by the endpoint, headers, validation results if a validation rule is defined, and detailed log records.

**Congratulations! You have created and accessed an API Proxy.**
