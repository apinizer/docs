The API Proxy list includes advanced search and filtering features:

#### Text Search

* **Search by Name**: Search by API Proxy name
* **Search by Description**: Search within API Proxy descriptions
* **Full Text Search**: Search across all fields

#### Filtering Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Status Filter">
    * **All**: All API Proxies
    * **Deployed**: Deployed API Proxies
    * **Undeployed**: Undeployed API Proxies
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Type Filter">

### Sorting

You can sort the API Proxy list by the following criteria:

* **By Name**: Alphabetical sorting (A-Z, Z-A)
* **By Date**: By last modification date (New-Old, Old-New)
* **By Status**: By deployment status
* **By Version**: By version number

## API Proxy Groups

API Proxy Groups allow you to logically group related API Proxies. Group-based management enables you to:

* Define common policies at the group level
* Apply bulk operations to group members
* Perform group-based access control
* View group statistics

### Group View

You can organize API Proxies by their groups by enabling group view in the API Proxy list:

* **Group-Based View**: View API Proxies by their groups
* **Group Details**: View group information and members
* **Group Statistics**: View group-based usage statistics

:::info More Information
For detailed information about creating and managing API Proxy Groups, see the [API Proxy Group Creation](/en/developer/api-proxy-group-creation) page.

## Tagging and Categorization

Tags are a flexible way to categorize your API Proxies. You can assign multiple tags to an API Proxy.

### Tag Creation and Management

#### Adding Tags

1. Go to the API Proxy detail page
2. Click on the **Tags** section
3. Select from existing tags or create a new tag
4. Save the tag

#### Tag Recommendations

Recommended categories for tagging:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Functional Categories" icon="puzzle-piece">
    * authentication
    * payment
    * reporting
    * integration
    * notification
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customer Categories" icon="building">
    * customer-a
    * customer-b
    * internal
    * external
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Categories" icon="code-branch">
    * v1
    * v2
    * legacy
    * beta
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Categories" icon="server">
    * production
    * staging
    * development
    * testing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Tag-Based Filtering

By filtering by tags, you can:

* View API Proxies belonging to a specific category
* Use multiple tag combinations
* Generate tag-based reports

## Bulk Operations

You can use bulk operation features to perform operations on multiple API Proxies simultaneously.

### Bulk Selection

In the API Proxy list:

1. **Multi-Selection Mode**: Enable multi-selection mode in the list
2. **Selection**: Select the desired API Proxies
3. **Bulk Operation Menu**: The bulk operation menu appears for selected API Proxies

### Supported Bulk Operations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bulk Deploy/Undeploy">
    You can deploy or undeploy selected API Proxies simultaneously.
    
    :::warning Warning
    Bulk deploy operation deploys all selected API Proxies to the target environment. This operation cannot be undone.
    :::
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Tag Add/Remove">
    You can add or remove tags from selected API Proxies simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Group Assignment">
    You can add selected API Proxies to an API Proxy Group simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Delete">
    You can delete selected API Proxies simultaneously.
    
    :::danger Important
    Delete operation cannot be undone. Make sure before deleting.
    :::

2. Enable multi-selection mode
3. Select API Proxies to be deployed
4. Select **Bulk Deploy** option
5. Select target environment and confirm

#### Scenario 2: Tag-Based Grouping

1. Filter API Proxies with a specific tag
2. Select all
3. Select **Bulk Group Assignment** option
4. Select target group and confirm

#### Scenario 3: Bulk Export and Backup

1. Select API Proxies to be backed up
2. Select **Bulk Export** option
3. Configure export settings
4. Start export operation

## View Options

The API Proxy list offers different view options:

### List View

Classic list view. Displays detailed information in table format.

### Card View

Displays API Proxies in card format. Each card includes:

* API Proxy name and icon
* Status indicator
* Tags
* Quick access buttons

### Compact View

Compact view can be used to view more API Proxies at once.

## Statistics and Reporting

The following statistics are displayed on the API Proxy list page:

* **Total API Proxy Count**: Total number of all API Proxies
* **Deployed Count**: Number of deployed API Proxies
* **Undeployed Count**: Number of undeployed API Proxies
* **Group Count**: Total number of API Proxy Groups
* **Tag Distribution**: API Proxy distribution by tags

## Best Practices

### Tagging Strategy

* **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in tag names
* **Descriptiveness**: Make sure tags are clear in meaning
* **Hierarchy**: Use hierarchical tag structure (e.g., `env:production`, `env:staging`)
* **Documentation**: Document tag usage rules

### Group Management

* **Logical Grouping**: Group related API Proxies logically
* **Group Size**: Don't make groups too large (recommended: 5-15 API Proxies)
* **Group Naming**: Keep group names descriptive and consistent

### Bulk Operations

* **Test in Test Environment**: Try bulk operations in test environment first
* **Backup**: Backup before important changes
* **Pre-Operation Check**: Check selected API Proxies before bulk operations
