Taskflow Monitor (Dashboard) provides a comprehensive view of all Task Flow executions, allowing you to monitor performance, track execution history, and debug issues in real-time.

## Overview

Taskflow Monitor is the central dashboard for monitoring and managing Task Flow executions in Apinizer. It provides real-time insights into Task Flow performance, execution status, and error tracking.

## Accessing Taskflow Monitor

To access Taskflow Monitor:

1. Navigate to **Integration & Automation** in the main menu
2. Select **API Integrator (Task Flow Builder)**
3. Click on **Taskflow Monitor** or **Dashboard**

## Dashboard Components

### Execution List

The execution list displays all Task Flow executions with the following information:

* **Task Flow Name**: Name of the executed Task Flow
* **Execution ID**: Unique identifier for each execution
* **Status**: Execution status (Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
* **Start Time**: When the execution started
* **Duration**: Execution time in milliseconds
* **Trigger Type**: How the Task Flow was triggered (API, Scheduled Job, Manual)

**Status Indicators:**

* 🟢 **Completed**: Execution finished successfully
* 🔴 **Failed**: Execution encountered an error
* 🟡 **Running**: Execution is currently in progress
* ⚪ **Cancelled**: Execution was cancelled

### Execution Details

Click on any execution to view detailed information:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Execution Summary">
    * Overall execution status
    * Total execution time
    * Number of tasks executed
    * Success/failure counts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Task Execution Timeline">
    * Sequential view of all tasks
    * Individual task execution times
    * Task dependencies and flow
    * Task status (Success/Failed/Skipped)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Input/Output Data">
    * Input variables and values
    * Output variables and results
    * Data transformations
    * Intermediate variable values
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error Details">
    * Error messages and stack traces
    * Failed task information
    * Error context and variables
    * Retry attempts and results
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Metrics

Monitor Task Flow performance with key metrics:

**Execution Metrics:**

* **Average Execution Time**: Average time to complete Task Flow
* **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
* **Throughput**: Number of executions per minute/hour
* **Peak Execution Time**: Longest execution time recorded

**Task-Level Metrics:**

* **Task Execution Times**: Individual task performance
* **Slowest Tasks**: Tasks taking the most time
* **Task Success Rates**: Success rate per task type

### Filtering and Search

Filter executions using various criteria:

**Filter Options:**

* **Status**: Filter by execution status
* **Task Flow**: Filter by specific Task Flow
* **Date Range**: Filter by execution time
* **Trigger Type**: Filter by how Task Flow was triggered
* **Duration**: Filter by execution duration

**Search:**

* Search by execution ID
* Search by Task Flow name
* Search by error messages

## Real-time Monitoring

Monitor active Task Flow executions in real-time:

### Active Executions

View currently running Task Flow executions:

* **Live Status**: See execution progress in real-time
* **Current Task**: Which task is currently executing
* **Elapsed Time**: How long the execution has been running
* **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress of the execution

### Execution Logs

View real-time execution logs:

* **Task Start/End Events**: When tasks start and complete
* **Variable Changes**: Variable value updates
* **Error Events**: Errors as they occur
* **Connector Activity**: Connector execution details

## Error Analysis

Analyze and debug Task Flow execution errors:

### Error Dashboard

View error statistics:

* **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed executions
* **Error Trends**: Error rate over time
* **Common Errors**: Most frequent error types
* **Error by Task**: Which tasks fail most often

### Error Details

For each error, view:

* **Error Message**: Detailed error description
* **Error Location**: Which task failed
* **Error Context**: Variable values at time of error
* **Stack Trace**: Full error stack trace
* **Retry Information**: Retry attempts and results

## Performance Analysis

Analyze Task Flow performance:

### Performance Trends

Track performance over time:

* **Execution Time Trends**: How execution times change
* **Throughput Trends**: Changes in execution frequency
* **Resource Usage**: CPU and memory usage patterns

### Bottleneck Identification

Identify performance bottlenecks:

* **Slow Tasks**: Tasks that take the longest time
* **Resource-Intensive Tasks**: Tasks consuming most resources
* **Parallel vs Sequential**: Compare parallel and sequential execution times

## Export and Reporting

Export execution data for analysis:

**Export Options:**

* **CSV Export**: Export execution list to CSV
* **JSON Export**: Export execution details to JSON
* **PDF Report**: Generate PDF reports
* **Scheduled Reports**: Automatically generate reports
