## Monitoring Features

### Cluster Health

Monitor Elasticsearch cluster health:

**Health Status:**

* **Green**: All primary and replica shards are allocated
* **Yellow**: All primary shards are allocated, but some replicas are not
* **Red**: Some primary shards are not allocated

### Performance Metrics

Track performance metrics:

**Metrics:**

* **Query Performance**: Query execution times
* **Indexing Performance**: Document indexing rates
* **Cluster Stats**: Cluster statistics
* **Node Stats**: Individual node statistics

### Connection Monitoring

Monitor connection status:

* **Connection Status**: Active/inactive connections
* **Response Times**: Connection response times
* **Error Rates**: Connection error rates
