Cron expressions provide a powerful way to define schedules for scheduled jobs. They allow you to specify when jobs should execute using a flexible syntax.

## Overview

Cron expressions consist of fields that represent different time units. They enable precise scheduling of job execution.

## Cron Expression Format

Cron expressions consist of 6 or 7 fields:

```
┌───────────── second (0-59)
│ ┌─────────── minute (0-59)
│ │ ┌───────── hour (0-23)
│ │ │ ┌─────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ │ ┌───── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ │ ┌─── day of week (0-7, 0 or 7 is Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │ │
* * * * * * *
```

**Field Order:**

1. **Second** (0-59)
2. **Minute** (0-59)
3. **Hour** (0-23)
4. **Day of Month** (1-31)
5. **Month** (1-12)
6. **Day of Week** (0-7, where 0 and 7 are Sunday)

## Common Patterns

### Every Minute

Execute every minute:

```
0 * * * * *
```

### Every Hour

Execute at the start of every hour:

```
0 0 * * * *
```

### Daily

Execute daily at specific time (e.g., 2:30 AM):

```
0 30 2 * * *
```

### Weekly

Execute weekly (e.g., every Monday at 9:00 AM):

```
0 0 9 * * 1
```

### Monthly

Execute monthly (e.g., 1st of every month at midnight):

```
0 0 0 1 * *
```

## Special Characters

### Asterisk (*)

Matches all values:

```
* * * * * *  // Every second
```

### Question Mark (?)

Used for day of month or day of week (one must be ?):

```
0 0 12 ? * *  // Every day at noon
```

### Hyphen (-)

Defines ranges:

```
0 0 9-17 * * *  // Every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM
```

### Comma (,)

Lists values:

```
0 0 9,12,15 * * *  // At 9 AM, 12 PM, and 3 PM
```

### Slash (/)

Defines increments:

```
0 */15 * * * *  // Every 15 minutes
0 0 */2 * * *   // Every 2 hours
```

## Examples

### Business Hours

Execute every hour during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM, Monday-Friday):

```
0 0 9-17 * * 1-5
```

### Every 5 Minutes

Execute every 5 minutes:

```
0 */5 * * * *
```

### First Day of Month

Execute on the first day of every month at midnight:

```
0 0 0 1 * *
```

### Last Day of Month

Execute on the last day of every month:

```
0 0 0 L * *
```

### Weekdays Only

Execute on weekdays at 9 AM:

```
0 0 9 * * 1-5
```
