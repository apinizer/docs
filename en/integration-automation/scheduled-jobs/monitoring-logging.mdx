## Execution Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

Monitor active job executions:

**Monitoring Information:**

* **Job Status**: Current execution status
* **Start Time**: When job started
* **Elapsed Time**: How long job has been running

### Job Status

Track job status:

**Status Values:**

* **Scheduled**: Job is scheduled
* **Running**: Job is executing
* **Completed**: Job completed successfully

* **Optimization**: Optimize job performance

## History Analysis

### Execution History

View job execution history:

**History Information:**

* **Execution Time**: When job executed
* **Duration**: Execution duration
* **Status**: Execution status
* **Output**: Job output
* **Errors**: Error information

### History Filtering

Filter execution history:

* **Date Range**: Filter by date range
* **Status**: Filter by status
* **Search**: Search history
