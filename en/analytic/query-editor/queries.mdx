## Use Cases

Definitions made in Query Editor can be used in the following screens:

* **Anomaly Detector**: Uses query definitions to detect abnormal situations
* **Report Generator**: Uses query and filter definitions to create customized reports
* **Chart Builder**: Uses query results for data visualizations

<Info>
All query definitions can be moved to the Admin page with the **"Globalize"** option. Globalized queries are removed from this list, become available for use in all projects, and their management is left to the Admin user.
</Info>

## Query Creation and Testing

After a query is created, it can be tested and its results can be viewed by adding a new filter or selecting from predefined filters.
