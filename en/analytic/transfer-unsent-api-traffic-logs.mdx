description: "You can transfer API traffic logs accumulated in failover connector to main connectors and prevent data loss. You can transfer data accumulated in Apinizer configuration database to main connectors and manually start the transfer operation."

<Note>
This screen is used to transfer data accumulated in Apinizer configuration database to the connectors they should go to, if **Apinizer configuration database is selected as failover connector**.
</Note>

This operation is started manually and if an error is received in the main connector, the operation is interrupted without data loss. It can be started again later from this screen.


When API Traffic Logs cannot be sent to the connector defined in the environment they are sent to, if the option to use failover connector is active in connector settings, they are sent to the failover connector. After the main connector is fixed, there is a need to transfer data sent to the failover connector to the target in the main connector.
