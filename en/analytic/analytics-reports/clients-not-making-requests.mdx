<Info>
Since an API Proxy can be loaded into multiple environments, metrics must also be evaluated according to the environment it is loaded into. Therefore, in all analytics screens, metrics are filtered by first selecting environment information.

## Filters

This report allows you to detect users who do not make requests or make few requests based on specific criteria. You can configure the filters by following the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Environment Selection">
    You must first select an environment to run the report. Environment selection is mandatory and metrics are filtered according to the selected environment.

    <Info>
    Since an API Proxy can be loaded into multiple environments, metrics must also be evaluated according to the environment it is loaded into.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Selection (Admin)">
    Multiple project selection is available for administrator users. When a project is selected, users in the selected projects are analyzed.

    <Note>
    This filter is only visible for administrator users.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="User Selection">
    You can specify the users to be analyzed by making multiple selections. If no selection is made, all users are analyzed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Status Filter">
    You can filter by the status of users:

    - **All**: Users in all statuses
    - **Active (ACTIVE)**: Users in active status
    - **Inactive (INACTIVE)**: Users in inactive status
  </Step>

  <Step title="Minimum Usage Count Threshold">
    You can define a minimum usage count threshold to determine the usage status of users. Users who make requests below the specified value are listed.

    This threshold allows you to detect users who are completely passive or make very few requests.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Maximum Usage Count Threshold">
    You can define a maximum usage count threshold to determine the usage status of users. Users who make requests above the specified value are listed.

    This threshold allows you to detect users within a specific usage range.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Date Range Selection">
    You can select the date range to be analyzed. When a date range is selected, only requests within this range are analyzed.
  </Step>
</Steps>
