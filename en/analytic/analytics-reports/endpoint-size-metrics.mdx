description: "You can analyze request and response size metrics of API Proxy endpoints in Apinizer. You can detect endpoints creating data traffic by grouping API Proxies in the project by method/endpoint information and take necessary actions for performance optimization."

<Note>
Since an API Proxy can be loaded into multiple environments, metrics must also be evaluated according to the environment it is loaded into. Therefore, in all analytics screens, metrics are filtered by first selecting environment information.
</Note>

<Warning>
Metric data cannot be displayed for environments where Elasticsearch integration is not configured. In this case, a warning message is displayed on the screen.
