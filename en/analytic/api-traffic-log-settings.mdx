## Log Record Regions

Message information coming to and going from API Proxies defined on Apinizer is logged in Elasticsearch database according to message elements (header, parameter, body).

These log record regions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Request from Client" icon="arrow-right">
    Request information coming from client to API Proxy
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request to Target" icon="arrow-right">
    Request information sent from API Proxy to Backend API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Response from Target" icon="arrow-left">
    Response information given from Backend API to API Proxy
  </Card>
  <Card title="Response to Client" icon="arrow-left">
    Response information sent from API Proxy to client
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By default, logging of fields in all message regions of the project is active. Logged fields can be restricted based on need or log server resource consumption.

Log settings are managed on a project and environment (environment) basis through this screen.

<Info>
For production environment, it is recommended to disable logging of elements belonging to the following regions.

- From API Proxy to Backend API (Request to Target)
- From Backend API to API Proxy (Response from Target)

If an API Proxy is running in production environment, it means that all policy settings and tests in the API Proxy are completed and no more development will be done.

Therefore, to prevent excessive growth of data in the database, it is recommended not to write header, parameter, and body data in these two regions.
</Info>

<Warning>
Even if all logging fields are closed, if an error occurs in the request, all log fields are recorded to detect the error. This feature can be opened and closed in general settings.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Due to variable data sizes and data formats, file parts of formdata requests are never logged. Only other metadata fields are logged.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Since WebSocket and gRPC requests are stored as data coming to Apinizer and data going out from Apinizer, there are only 2 regions in these types of API Proxies.
</Warning>

API Proxy-based log settings can be made on this screen. Additionally, if integration settings have been made, which API Proxies' traffic records can be sent to these integration targets can also be configured.
