## Data Structure

For detailed information about the data structure of API traffic log records, you can refer to the [API Traffic Log Record Data Structure](/en/analytic/api-traffic-log-record-data-structure) page.

## Important Notes
<Warning>
- Querying and analytical visualization of API Traffic in Apinizer Management Console is only possible by adding an Elasticsearch Connector to the relevant environment.
- If multiple Elasticsearch Connectors are defined, data from the **first** Elasticsearch Connector added in Apinizer Management Console can be viewed.
</Warning>

<Note>
- In the section under the Project menu, reporting can only be done on metrics under the project.
- In the section under the Admin menu, reporting can be done on all metrics.
- API Proxy Traffic (Over Time) and API Proxy Creation Report pages are exclusive to Admin.
