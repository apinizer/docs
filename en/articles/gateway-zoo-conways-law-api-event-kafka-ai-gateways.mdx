title: "Gateway Zoo: API, Event, Kafka, and AI Gateways from Conway's Law Perspective"
description: "The expansion of API Gateway to Event, Kafka, AI Gateways and its relation to Conway's Law"
---

Let's start with the famous statement of Conway's Law:

*"Organizations that design systems are constrained to produce designs that are copies of their communication structures."*

This powerful perspective offers a critical key to understanding why **API Gateway** scope is constantly being extended with concepts like **Event Gateway, Kafka Gateway, AI Gateway, Agent Gateway**, and the like.

On one hand, this expansion risks turning API gateways into the bulky ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) structures of the past; on the other, we should not ignore scenarios where certain integrations can add value in line with technological evolution and pragmatic needs. Striking this balance sits at the center of modern architectural decisions.

A good starting point for understanding these dynamics is the relationship between **API Gateway** and **Service Mesh** technologies. In the generally accepted approach, API Gateways handle "north–south" traffic (from external clients to internal services), while Service Meshes focus on "east–west" traffic (inter-service communication). Using these two technologies together, each specialized in its domain, yields a more scalable, manageable, and performant architecture for most large-scale, complex systems.

However, especially in smaller projects where resources are limited or system complexity is low, or within the capabilities of certain platform products, combining both functions in a single tool can be a pragmatic and reasonable solution.

## Organizational Structures and Technological Echoes

The link between organizational structures and technology choices is unavoidable. In setups where different teams build systems in their own silos and communication and coordination are strained, integration can become a serious problem. API Gateways have gained popularity as a way to fill these organizational gaps and build bridges between silos.

ESBs, born of a similar need, can still be functional in certain enterprise integration scenarios, but they have often become bloated and an obstacle to change because of the claim to be the **"one tool that solves everything."** Whether API Gateways fall into a similar trap depends largely on how organizations position these tools with awareness of Conway's Law, how clearly they draw responsibility boundaries, and whether they try to paper over fundamental organizational issues with technology.

## Business Logic Creeping into the Gateway: Risks and Pragmatic Assessment

The question of business logic creeping into API Gateways calls for conscious judgment rather than rigid rules. Although this is often a symptom of organizational issues (poor communication, avoiding responsibility), it can sometimes offer pragmatic benefits:

- **Data transformations:** Simple formatting or field mapping in the gateway can be efficient. However, transformations that involve complex business rules (e.g. detailed financial calculations) or change frequently are usually healthier in the application layer or a dedicated integration service, so the gateway stays focused and maintainable.

- **Authorization rules:** Basic authentication and simple role checks (e.g. general endpoint access) can be managed centrally in the gateway. But resource-specific, business-rule-based, or highly detailed authorization logic is better owned by the relevant microservice or a dedicated authorization service, so responsibilities are distributed correctly.

- **Event processing:** Basic event filtering or simple routing rules may live in the gateway in some scenarios. For complex event correlation, anomaly detection, or stateful event-processing logic, dedicated event-processing platforms or messaging systems are better for architectural clarity and scalability.

The key is not a dogmatic "never put business logic in the gateway" but a conscious evaluation of which part of the logic belongs in which layer from the standpoint of architectural principles, performance, security, scalability, and organizational capability. Drawing the boundaries correctly is essential.

## From Developer to Specialized Roles: Opportunities and Pitfalls

Software teams specializing around certain platform components (e.g. API Gateway) reflect the organization's capability management and technology strategy, and bring both opportunities and risks. For example, using an AI Gateway product to integrate AI services quickly can shorten time to market and provide focused expertise. But there can be downsides:

- **Advantages:** Fast value delivery, deep expertise in a specific area, full use of the platform's capabilities.

- **Disadvantages:** The team becoming dependent on a narrow technology or product (vendor lock-in risk), general software development skills eroding, reduced organizational flexibility to adapt to different solutions.

**The ideal balance depends on the organization's size, strategic goals, resources, and culture.** Large organizations may prefer to create roles and teams with deep specialization, while smaller or more agile organizations may encourage T-shaped competencies with broader responsibility.

## Balance Between Pragmatic Solutions and Ideal Architectures

Real-world projects rarely proceed with purely "ideal" architectures. Often, pragmatic decisions are needed because of existing constraints, time pressure, and business needs:

- **"Save the day" and pragmatic approaches:** A bank temporarily adding "AI features" to its existing API Gateway to meet an urgent business need can be a reasonable step when resources are limited, market pressure is high, or the goal is to buy time until a more permanent solution is built. Such decisions can be seen as consciously taken and managed "technical debt."

- **"Ideal" and long-term approaches:** The same bank developing a purpose-built orchestration layer or a dedicated AI Gateway solution for AI services in line with its long-term strategy offers a more scalable, sustainable, and flexible architecture. This approach lets each technology play to its strengths and eases future evolution of the architecture. It does, however, require more upfront investment, time, and organizational coordination.

Successful organizations strike a conscious balance between these two approaches: they neither always jump to the fastest solution nor miss opportunities while waiting for perfection.

## Technological Evolution, Diverging Needs, and Decision Factors

The spread of concepts like Event Gateway, Kafka Gateway, AI Gateway, and Agent Gateway shows that technology and business needs keep evolving and different communication patterns are emerging. Whether to address this new functionality inside existing API Gateways or to develop it as separate, specialized products/components is a strategic decision with no simple right/wrong answer; it depends on factors such as:

- **Scale and complexity of the organization:** Large, complex systems usually benefit from specialized components.

- **Team structure and expertise:** The capabilities and responsibility areas of existing teams.

- **Nature and urgency of business needs:** How complex the required functionality is and how quickly it must go live.

- **Cost, resource constraints, and management overhead:** Total cost of ownership of adding a new tool vs. extending the current one.

- **Long-term strategic goals and architectural vision:** Expectations for future flexibility and scalability.

- **Capabilities of the current API Gateway:** Modern API Gateway platforms can have more modular, plugin-based architectures than ESBs, which can make some integrations more manageable. But this modularity should not be a reason to put everything under one roof.

## Solution: Conscious Decisions and a Balanced Approach

![Conscious architectural decisions](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*0IK2ZDDYU2e_cZhO.png)

Managing the effects of Conway's Law and building healthy technological architectures requires conscious steps on both the organizational and technological sides:

1. **Set conscious, pragmatic boundaries:** Clearly define the core responsibility areas of each technology (API Gateway, Service Mesh, Event Broker, AI Gateway, etc.). But draw these boundaries pragmatically, taking the project's and organization's context into account, rather than by rigid dogma. In some cases, controlled overlap is acceptable.

2. **Align technology choices with business needs and organizational context:** Base technology decisions not only on popular trends but on the ability to solve real business problems, your organization's scale, resources, and your teams' capabilities. There is no "one right answer for everyone."

3. **Apply Conway's Law consciously (accept bidirectional effect):** Aim for organizational structures that support your ideal architecture. But accept that organizational change takes time and that technological choices can sometimes trigger organizational evolution.

4. **Focus on organizational improvement:** Technology can be a tool to address organizational issues (poor communication, silos, unclear responsibilities) but is never the solution by itself. Focus on root causes.

5. **Phased transition and manageable technical debt:** The ideal architecture is rarely reached overnight. Develop phased transition strategies toward new approaches while still getting value from existing systems, and manage the technical debt you take on in a conscious way.

## Conclusion: Context-Based, Conscious Architectural Choices

Whether concepts like Event Gateway, Kafka Gateway, and AI Gateway should be integrated into API Gateways or treated as separate products depends on the organization's context.

For large-scale, complex, long-lived systems, designing these functions as separate, specialized products or components with well-defined interfaces between them usually offers a more sustainable, scalable, and manageable approach. This helps prevent API Gateways from sharing the fate of ESBs.

For smaller organizations, prototypes, situations with resource constraints, or specific, simple integration needs, pragmatically addressing some functions within the existing API Gateway platform may be more efficient.

What matters is making these decisions consciously—evaluating the factors above carefully and weighing potential benefits and risks—rather than in haste or by assumption.

Learning from past ESB experience, we should keep API Gateways focused on their core value (API management, security, traffic control), make extension decisions in a measured way, and *prefer* specialized solutions for different needs, without ruling out pragmatic integration where it makes sense. In the end, the future of API Gateways will depend on how skillfully we manage this complex dance between technology and organization.
