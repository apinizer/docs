title: "Active-Active Architecture with Apinizer and Eliminating SPOF Risk"
description: "Reducing single point of failure (SPOF) risk, high availability, and geographic distribution"

One of the biggest expectations of API management teams is that the system runs on an architecture that is always reachable, reliable, and flexible. Today, simply exposing an API is not enough: that API must never go down, be accessible from everywhere, and respond quickly.

**What if the API Gateway that handles this traffic becomes unreachable?**

## Single Point of Failure (SPOF) Problem

One of the main weaknesses of traditional API management solutions is that they carry a "Single Point of Failure" (SPOF) risk. SPOF means having one component whose failure can bring down the entire system. For example, if all your API traffic goes through a single API Gateway, when that gateway stops working, all your API services are disrupted.

**This is exactly where Apinizer’s active-active architecture support comes in.** This design addresses core expectations like high availability and flexibility. It not only keeps your API infrastructure up but also makes it more reliable and sustainable.

## What Are Single Point of Entry and Active-Active Architecture?

"Single Point of Entry" means all requests enter the system through one logical point. This has advantages for security and management, but if that single point fails, the whole system is affected. Apinizer’s active-active architecture keeps the benefits of a single point of entry while eliminating the Single Point of Failure risk.

Apinizer behaves logically as a single API Gateway while running physically on multiple active nodes. So it offers one entry point to the outside world while, thanks to the underlying architecture, continuing to serve traffic without interruption even when one or more nodes fail.

## What Is Active-Active Architecture?

In an active-active architecture, multiple instances (e.g. application servers or databases) are active at the same time. These instances typically share incoming traffic through a load balancer. If one instance fails, the others keep running and service continues without interruption.

**Benefits:**

- **High availability:** If one component fails, the others keep serving; SPOF risk is removed.
- **Load balancing:** Because all components run at once, resource usage is more balanced.
- **Scalability:** New components can be added easily; the system can scale horizontally.
- **Better performance:** Multiple servers running in parallel allow more throughput.

The benefits of active-active architecture make a real difference where uninterrupted service is critical, such as in API management. Apinizer’s support for this architecture makes your API infrastructure reliable and future-ready by removing SPOF risk.

In traditional systems, **active-passive** architecture is common: one primary and one or more standby systems; when the primary is down, the standby takes over. It has drawbacks: downtime during failover, underused standby capacity, and it can still represent a SPOF. **Active-active** architecture removes this risk by having all nodes active at once.

## Benefits of Active-Active Architecture for Businesses

### High Availability (HA) and SPOF Elimination

Apinizer’s active-active architecture can deliver 99.999%+ availability in theory (downtime measured in minutes per year). Because each node can run independently, Single Point of Failure risk is effectively eliminated.

**Improved scalability:** When your API traffic grows, horizontal scaling is straightforward. When you add a new node, it integrates quickly, configuration is synchronized automatically, and traffic starts balancing immediately.

### Sustainable Operations and Maintenance

Active-active architecture also helps operations:

- You don’t need to take the whole system down for maintenance.
- Nodes can be updated in sequence, enabling near-zero-downtime upgrades.
- Problem isolation is easier; a faulty node can be taken out of the traffic path.

## What Do API Outages Cost Your Business and Public Services?

Today, a large share of your customers reach your services through APIs. Payment systems, mobile apps, and partner integrations depend on these APIs. If your API gateway becomes unreachable, every minute of outage can:

- Cause direct revenue loss
- Damage customer trust
- Disrupt operations
- Prevent meeting legal or regulatory obligations
- Disrupt public services

Industry analyses show that in large setups, the cost of API outages can reach tens of thousands of dollars per hour. Making your API infrastructure resilient is not optional; it is critical for business continuity.

## Uninterrupted API Service with Apinizer

With Apinizer’s active-active architecture support you can:

- Remove SPOF risk from your API infrastructure and make it more resilient and reliable
- Use system resources more efficiently
- Run maintenance and updates with near-zero downtime
- Build a scalable setup that can respond to growing demand

You can both ensure business continuity and offer customers an experience that is always available, fast, and trustworthy.

## How Apinizer Delivers Active-Active High Availability

Apinizer uses Kubernetes **nodeAffinity** effectively for high availability. As a result:

- Pods are distributed in a controlled way across specific nodes
- At least one Apinizer pod is guaranteed to run on each worker node
- All pods are prevented from crowding onto a single node

For example, if you have a Kubernetes cluster on two physical servers, you can configure Apinizer to run on both. If one server goes down, Apinizer pods on the other continue to serve traffic, ensuring uninterrupted API access.

## Extra Resilience with Geographic Distribution

Beyond active-active within a cluster, Apinizer supports geographically distributed setups. Clusters in different physical locations can act as a single logical system. So the system is protected not only from hardware failures but also from broader risks such as natural disasters, power outages, or regional network issues.

Apinizer keeps the **Single Point of Entry** idea while turning geographically separate data centers (e.g. Istanbul and Ankara) into parts of the same logical system. Active pods run in each location and load is balanced across them.

**What does this give you?**

- If the infrastructure in one city goes down, the system in the other keeps running
- Geographic redundancy helps maintain service even in disaster scenarios
- Load can be distributed dynamically across locations
- Traffic can be routed to the server closest to the user for better performance

When all these architectural elements are combined, Apinizer is not only an API management platform but also a foundation for uninterrupted service. With Apinizer’s active-active and geographically redundant architectures, your API infrastructure can stay reachable, resilient, and ready for the future.
