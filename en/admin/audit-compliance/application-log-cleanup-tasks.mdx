description: "You can configure automatic cleanup tasks for application logs in Apinizer, control database size, and provide performance optimization. You can manage database growth by automatically cleaning log records before the specified date."

<Info>
Various data may need to be logged in Apinizer. This data may not be meaningful after a certain period and may cause database growth. It will be beneficial to clean the collections given below at regular intervals.

If this operation is desired to be done automatically, the setting for logs to be deleted can be made from this screen. For active records, a task that runs at the beginning of each hour if hour is selected, or at 00:00 each night if day is selected, deletes relevant records before the specified date.
