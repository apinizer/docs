<Info>
Server Management provides all the tools needed to create and manage environments where API Proxies will run in the Apinizer platform, manage Kubernetes resources, configure Gateway Engine and Cache server, configure SSL/TLS certificates, and manage API traffic log connectors.
</Info>

## Module Core Components

The Server Management module provides infrastructure and environment management for the Apinizer platform. With this module:

- Environments where API Proxies will run are created and managed
- Kubernetes resources and deployments are managed
- Gateway Engine and Cache server configurations are made
- SSL/TLS certificates are configured
- API traffic log connectors are managed

## Module Components

The Server Management module is managed through the following pages:
