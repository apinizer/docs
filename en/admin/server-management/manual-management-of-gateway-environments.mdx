title: "Manual Management of Gateway Environments"
description: "You can define created Kubernetes definitions to the Apinizer platform. You can manage Kubernetes environments created manually and configure Gateway and Cache server access URLs."
---

<Info>
Environment is a runtime execution context for API Proxies in an organization. This section will explain the process of defining created kubernetes definitions to the Apinizer platform.

This appears when the **Kubernetes Namespace and Resources are managed with Apinizer** option is marked as **Inactive** from the System General Settings screen.

**An image containing general definition information of the environment is shown below:**

Fields containing general definition information of the environment are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Type  | Test or Production can be selected as type so that it is not deducted from the Test license. |
| Name  | The name of the environment. |
| Key *(Key)* | A shortened key specific to the environment used for the created environment. |
| Access URL Address *(Access URL)* | The external access address of API Proxies running within the environment. It has been explained in detail in [a previous section](/en/admin/server-management/environments). |
| Description  | Can be used for management convenience and important notes. |
| Gateway Server Access URL *(Gateway Server Access URL)* | The service access address of nodeport or ingress type required for configurations made in Apinizer Management Console to be loaded to Gateway Pods is entered here.<br/><br/>Example: *http://worker-service.prod.svc.cluster.local:8091* |
| Cache Server Access URL *(Cache Server Access URL)* | The service access address of nodeport or ingress type required for configurations made in Apinizer Management Console to be loaded to Cache Pods or for Gateway Pods to access cache pods is entered here.<br/><br/>Example: *http://cache-service.prod.svc.cluster.local:8090* |
| API Proxy Traffic Log Connectors *(API Traffic Log Connectors)* | Log connectors where all API Proxy Traffic and extensions in the environment will be logged are defined here. For more information about adding connectors to the environment, please see [this page](/en/admin/server-management/adding-connectors-to-gateway-environments). |
| Projects *(Projects)* | Projects where the environment can be used can be selected from here, or the selection can be left empty for use in all projects. If one or more project selections are made, they must also be added for use in newly created projects. It comes as unselected by default. If a project is selected, it means that only API Proxies within that project can be deployed to this environment. |
| Define your Gateway Server as HTTPS *(Define your Gateway Server as HTTPs)* | If HTTPS is desired, the HTTPS Enabled option is also selected. In this case, the necessary files for encryption must be uploaded. |
| Keystore | When HTTPS protocol is selected, keystore files can be uploaded in JKS or PFX format. |
| Truststore | When HTTPS protocol is selected, truststore files can be uploaded in JKS or PFX format. |
| Keystore Password *(Keystore Password)* | The password for the keystore file is entered. |
| Truststore Password *(Truststore Password)* | The password for the truststore file is entered. |
| mTLS Enabled *(mTLS Enabled)* | The mTLS setting can only be selected when the HTTPS setting is open since it runs on HTTPS protocol and allows the server to request authentication from the client, but does not force it as a strict requirement to establish the connection. If mTLS authorization is desired to be mandatory, the [mTLS policy](/en/develop/policies/mtls-authentication) should be used. |
