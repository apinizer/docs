<Info>
Server Management enables creating, managing, and deploying the infrastructure of Apinizer running on Kubernetes. You don't need to know Kubernetes to do this. Apinizer communicates with Kubernetes APIs by entering only the required information from the screen, ensuring all operations are performed automatically.

In this section, Elasticsearch server definitions, API Integration environment configuration and management are also performed.
