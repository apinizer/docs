# Projects

The function of a project is to group and manage all entities related to designing, publishing, developing, and analyzing a group of APIs.

Therefore, the project structure is one of the most important structures in Apinizer.

API Proxies categorized under a purpose framework and their related connections and configurations make management related to the API lifecycle easier.

Apinizer provides a **Default** project on first installation. This Default project cannot be edited or deleted.

After project definition is made, members are generally defined according to their roles. Click [here](/en/admin/project-management/project-members) for detailed information about member definition.

## Project Creation

All projects in Apinizer can be viewed from the **Management → Projects** screen or a new project can be created.

A project can be created in two ways:

- A new project definition can be made with the **New (Create)** button.
- A project can be created by loading an existing project configuration file by clicking the **Import Project** link.

**The visual containing the project list is provided below:**

<Warning>
If a user with **Project Owner** role is deleted from that project; **Admin** user becomes Project Owner for that project.
</Warning>


**The visual containing project settings is provided below:**

The fields used for project configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
