Through the Members screen, authorization can be made for selected projects by assigning roles to users or teams created in Apinizer.

A separate role can be defined for each project for a user or team.

When a team is added as a member to a project, there is no need to select a role. Since the roles of users in the team are defined when adding the team, the roles of users within the team are valid.

## Adding Team

To add members from a team to the active project, select the team from the list in the **Select Users and/or Teams** field, then click the **Add** button.
