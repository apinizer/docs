description: "You can manage access permissions of credentials of clients that will access API Proxy Groups and configure details of these permissions. You can grant API Proxy Group-based access permission to credentials and configure quota and throttling settings."

<Warning>
Credential access permission alone is not sufficient for API Proxy Group access.

For the settings in the credential and access permission to be valid, one of the authentication policies must be added on the API Proxy Group and the **Security Manager** option must be selected as the authentication method in this policy.
</Warning>

On this page, all API Proxy Groups belonging to the project in which the authorized application user is included are listed, and can be filtered optionally.
