<Info>
Identity Management provides all the necessary tools to manage credentials of clients that will access API Proxies in the Apinizer platform, create access control lists (ACL), perform contract and protocol management, manage organizations and IP groups, configure identity providers, and generate access reports.
</Info>

<Warning>
Credential access permission alone is not sufficient for API proxy access. For the settings in the credential and access permission to be valid, one of the authentication policies must be added on the API Proxy and the **Security Manager** option must be selected as the authentication method in this policy.
</Warning>

## Module Core Components

The Identity Management module provides centralized management of credentials and access control lists of clients that will access API Proxies. With this module:

- Client credentials and access permissions are managed
- Contract and protocol management is performed
- Organizations and IP groups are created
- Identity providers are configured
- Access reports are generated

## Module Components

The Identity Management module is managed through the following pages:

## Identity Providers

Identity providers specify the user pool to be given to clients. These predefined identity providers are used when creating authentication policies.
