title: "Credentials"
description: "You can create, manage credentials of clients that will access API Proxies and configure access control settings. You can perform access control through credentials or API Proxies, configure token settings, and define JWK/mTLS settings."
---

<Info>
Access control settings made with Identity Management in Apinizer can be configured in 2 different ways:

1. **Through credentials:** Go to the credential detail. In the credential detail, API Proxies that have been granted access permission and their settings are viewed and operations are performed.
2. **Through API Proxies:** Go to the API Proxy detail. Credentials that have been granted access permission to the API Proxy are viewed and operations are performed.

This page fulfills the condition in the first option.
</Info>

<Warning>
Credential access permission alone is not sufficient for API proxy access. For the settings in the credential and access permission to be valid, one of the authentication policies must be added on the API Proxy and the **Security Manager** option must be selected as the authentication method in this policy.
</Warning>

## Credential List

**An image showing the list of existing credentials when the credentials page is first opened is shown below:**

<img

  alt="Credential List"
  width="1000"
  height="600"
/>

The fields used for screen components are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| Advanced Search _(Advanced Search)_ | Used to perform detailed search on credentials. |
| Access Control List _(Access Control List)_ | Table where credentials are listed and sorted. |
| Create _(Create)_ | Used to create a new "Credential". |
| Import From CSV _(Import From CSV)_ | Used for bulk credential saving. |
| Import _(Import)_ | Used to import credential as .json or .zip extension. |
| Export Credential List as an Excel File _(Export Credential List as an Excel File)_ | Used to download the credentials list as an excel file. |
| Export _(Export)_ | All data belonging to the credential can be exported to be reused in another project. In this process, only general information is exported. Advanced settings, API Proxy ACL, API Proxy Group ACL, JWK settings, and mTLS settings are not exported as they are project-based information. |

## Bulk Credential Import via CSV

The import from CSV feature can be used to import existing credentials to Apinizer.

If this feature is desired to be used;

<Steps>
<Step title="Data Format">
Existing user information should be written with each record on one line.
</Step>
<Step title="Information Content">
The record must contain username and password information together and the password information must be in plain text.
</Step>
<Step title="Separator Usage">
The **#** sign should be placed as a separator between **username** and **password** information.
</Step>
<Step title="Line Separation">
Each line should be separated with the Enter key.
</Step>
</Steps>

Data prepared in this way is entered into the opened screen and the import button is pressed.

As seen in this image, we can perform two types of operations on credentials:

1. Entering, creating, or updating credential details
2. Creating or updating the credential's access control list

Credential field descriptions are as follows:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|

| Environment Password _(Environment Password)_ | A password can be entered to be used specifically for the environment in the relevant row. |
| Environment IP List _(Environment IP List)_ | An IP list can be entered to be used specifically for the environment in the relevant row. |

## Credential Access Control Settings

To set access permissions for the credential, operations are performed by switching to the **Access Control List** panel.

In this panel, the API Proxy for which access permission is desired to be granted is selected from the screen that appears when the button marked in red in the image below is pressed.

<img
  src="/images/yonetici/kimlik-ayarlari.png"
  alt="Credential Access Control Settings"
  width="1000"
  height="600"
/>
From the opened screen, the desired API Proxy(ies) are selected and the **Add** button marked in red below is pressed.

<img

With this operation, access permission is granted to the credential for the selected API Proxies. For this operation to become active on live running rules, it must be deployed to environments.

For this, when operations are completed, press the **Save and Deploy** button in the upper right corner to activate the settings.
