title: "Contracts/Protocols"
description: "You can perform contract/protocol management with clients, create API Proxy and credential associations. You can ensure that contract/protocol text is kept with its history, find contracts that will expire, and configure automatic removal of credential access permissions upon contract expiration."

<Info>
In some cases, services to be provided to clients may need to be opened and/or used through a contract/protocol. In such cases, it may be necessary to keep the contract/protocol text with its history and know which services and credentials are associated with this contract/protocol.

**When the Contracts/Protocols page is first entered, all existing contract/protocol records are listed as shown in the image below:**
