description: "You can view detailed permission matrices of predefined project-level roles in Apinizer. You can learn which actions each role has in which asset categories."

<Info>
    In Apinizer, it is impossible for a user to access a project without authorization, or even perform an action within
    that project that is outside their authorization level. Users must have a role(s) to be able to perform actions in
    any project.
</Info>

<Info>
    This page contains detailed permission matrices for project-level roles. For the general authorization model and
    system-level roles, see the [Authorization Matrix](/en/admin/user-access-management/authorization-matrix) page.
</Info>

If a user or team needs more or fewer permissions than those in the default roles, a new role can be created that can be fully customized accordingly.
