description: "You can manage user roles, use default roles and create new roles. You can configure role-based authorization and assign necessary roles for users to perform operations in projects."

<Info>
In Apinizer, it is not possible for a user to access a project they do not have permission for, or even perform an action that is not within their authority within the same project. Users need to have role/roles to perform operations in any project.

When the system is first installed, commonly used roles (API Developer, API Analytics, API Manager, API Creator, Project Owner) come ready. Default roles can be used to authorize users or teams, or new roles can be defined.

In Apinizer; there are 5 default roles: API Developer, API Analytics, API Manager, API Creator and Project Owner.
</Info>

These roles and the permissions of the roles are explained in detail below:
