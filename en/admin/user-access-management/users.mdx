## Importance of User Management

User management plays a critical role for the Apinizer platform to work securely and efficiently. With correct user definitions and role assignments:

* **Security**: Each user can only perform operations they are authorized for
* **Efficiency**: Users can focus on their areas of responsibility
* **Traceability**: User-based operations can be tracked and reported
* **Scalability**: Centralized user management is provided in large organizations

## User Types

There are two types of user types system-wide; **User** and **System Administrator (Admin)**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="User" icon="user">
        User only has login permission in Apinizer and is authorized to perform operations within the scope of their role/roles in the project they are added as a member. These users can use the platform within the scope of their assigned projects and roles.
    </Card>
    <Card title="System Administrator (Admin)" icon="user-shield">
        Users with System Administrator role have permission to perform all operations in Apinizer. They can perform all management operations in the Administration menu and have full control authority platform-wide.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Roles and Project Membership

A user can have different roles in different projects. For example, while having the API Developer role in project A, they can be API Analytics in project B, and API Developer and API Analytics in project C.

Similarly, different roles can be defined for a user in different teams.

### Flexible Role Management

There is a flexible role management system for users in Apinizer:

* **Project-Based Roles**: Each user can work with different roles in different projects
* **Team-Based Roles**: Users can be in different teams with different roles
* **Multiple Role Support**: A user can have more than one role in the same project
* **Dynamic Authorization**: Roles can be managed dynamically on a project and team basis

### Usage Scenarios

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Project-Based Organization" icon="folder">
        Users are added as members to projects and roles are assigned on a project basis. For example:
        * API Developer in E-Commerce project
        * API Analytics in Payment project
        * Both Developer and Analytics in Reporting project
    </Card>
    <Card title="Team-Based Organization" icon="users">
        Users are added as members to teams and roles are assigned on a team basis. When a team is added to projects, team members are automatically added to the project.
    </Card>
