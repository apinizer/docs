<Info>
Filters are policies that ensure security with **Content Control**-based defense against API/Web Service attacks. If the filter/filters you have defined are found in the header, parameter and message content (body) of requests coming from clients, they will be blocked or deleted by Apinizer. Apinizer offers API developers (API Developer) two different options for blocking or deleting the request.

There are 17 default filters available in the Apinizer Platform and commonly used in the API world:

- ASCII Control Character

- Content Longer Than 1024 Chars
- DOCTYPE DTD Reference
- Java Exception Information Leakage
- JavaScript Injection Attack
- OR Attack
- Printf Format String Insertion Attack

In addition to the above, you can write your own **Regular Expressions**.

You cannot edit and delete those added by Apinizer by default.
