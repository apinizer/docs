<Info>
Request header is an HTTP header (Http Header) that can be used in HTTP requests to provide information about the request context so that the server can adapt the response. For example, Accept- * headers indicate the allowed and preferred formats of the response. Other headers can be used to provide authentication information (Authorization, to control caching, or to get information about user agent or referrer, etc.).

There are 33 Request Header Values by default in the Apinizer Platform:
