## Apinizer License Types

There are two types of licenses in Apinizer. **Perpetual** and **Time Limited.**

<Warning>
If you have a **Time Limited** license, the Apinizer Management Console will not open when your license period expires. However, services will continue to run.
</Warning>

<Info>
In **Perpetual License** usage, you will not be able to make new version updates when your maintenance period ends. You will receive a warning in the Apinizer Management Console when the license or maintenance period is about to expire. Please contact your Apinizer consultant to avoid problems in this case.
