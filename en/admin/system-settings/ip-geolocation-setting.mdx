<Info>
IP Geolocation is used especially to ensure security and control traffic coming from certain countries or cities. Using geolocation data, blocking operations can be performed based on the country and city where IP addresses are located. When the IP Geolocation feature is enabled through the admin panel, IP-based filtering and reporting operations can be performed.
