<Info>
System Settings provides all the necessary tools to manage the general configuration and system settings of the Apinizer platform. With this module, critical system configurations such as application-based API Proxy access address definition, API traffic log settings, Captcha and session management, predefined values (CORS headers, filter rules, HTTP header names/values), LDAP login configuration, license management, error message customization, and IP geolocation settings can be performed. The System Settings module works as the platform's basic configuration center and allows you to manage settings that are valid across the entire system from a central point.
</Info>

<Warning>
Only users with the **Administrator (Admin)** role can access the System Settings menu. Settings in this menu should be configured carefully as they are effective platform-wide.
</Warning>

## Module Components

The System Settings module is managed through the following pages:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="General Settings" icon="gear" href="/en/admin/system-settings/global-configuration">
    Configurations valid platform-wide such as API Proxy access address, Kubernetes management, log settings, Captcha and session management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Predefined Values" icon="list" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/byte-array-content-types.mdx">
    Management of predefined values to be used in API Gateways and Test Console such as CORS headers, filter rules, HTTP header names/values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LDAP Login Settings" icon="sign-in-alt" href="/en/admin/system-settings/ldap-login-settings">
    Login configuration to Apinizer Management Console with LDAP identity management system and enterprise identity systems integration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="License Management" icon="certificate" href="/en/admin/system-settings/license-management">
    Viewing Apinizer license information, license update, and management of perpetual/time-limited license types.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error Messages" icon="exclamation-triangle" href="/en/admin/system-settings/error-messages">

    Filtering and reporting operations based on country and city by determining the geographical locations of IP addresses.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Predefined Values

Under Predefined Values, global definitions are made so that they are ready and selectable in API Gateways and Test Console. These values ensure that frequently used values are managed from a central location when creating and configuring API Proxies and increase consistency.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="CORS Headers" icon="shield" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/cors-headers">
    Managing header definitions used in CORS settings and creating predefined CORS header values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CORS Origin Values" icon="globe" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/cors-origin-values">
    Managing origin values used in CORS settings and creating predefined CORS origin values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filter Rules" icon="filter" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/filter-rules">
    Defining security filters globally so they are ready and selectable in API Gateways. SQL injection, XSS and other attack filters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request Header Names" icon="header" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/http-request-header-names">
    Defining HTTP request header names globally so they are ready and selectable in API Gateways and Test Console.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request Header Values" icon="tag" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/http-request-header-values">
    Defining HTTP request header values globally so they are ready and selectable in API Gateways and Test Console.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Byte Array Content Types" icon="file-code" href="/en/admin/system-settings/predefined-values/byte-array-content-types">
    Managing byte array content types and creating predefined byte array content type values.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Default values in the **Predefined Values** section (CORS headers, filter rules, HTTP header values, etc.) cannot be edited or deleted. However, you can add your own custom values in addition to these values and use them in API Proxy configurations.
</Tip>

<Info>
For changes made on the **General Settings** page to be valid, the **Apply Changes** button must be clicked. Also, some settings (for example API Root Context) may require the platform to be restarted when changed.
</Info>

<Warning>
On the **License Management** page, if you have a time-limited license and your license period expires, the Apinizer Management Console will not open. However, services will continue to run. If you have a perpetual license, you will not be able to make new version updates when your maintenance period ends. You will receive a warning in the Apinizer Management Console when the license or maintenance period is about to expire.
</Warning>
