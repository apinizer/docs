title: "Export Import"
description: "You can export/import API Proxy, global policies, and project configurations, transfer between environments, and perform configuration management. API Proxies in the project, global policies, or project with all entities can be exported with the Export/Import Wizard."
---

<Info>
API Proxies in the project can be exported/imported with the Export/Import Wizard (Import/Export Wizard), global policies or project can be exported with all entities. The main purpose of Export/Import is to enable integration of the configuration into another project or Apinizer in another environment.

## Usage Scenarios

### Transfer Between Environments

Assume that there are two Apinizer applications installed in two different environments named production and test due to access restrictions. The production environment serves clients, while the test environment serves software developers. It is desired that API Proxies and applied policies and configurations in the test environment also be applied to the production environment. In this case, the API Proxy in the test environment is exported. Then the created configuration files are applied to the production environment.

### Configuration Tracking

Configuration changes can be tracked. The organization may want to track differences in policy settings due to security rules. For this, the exported policy, API Proxy, or project configuration file should be added to the CI process.
