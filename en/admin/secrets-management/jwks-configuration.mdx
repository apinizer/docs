## JWK Association

When a JWK is created, the system automatically records which source it is associated with based on the source type. This relationship is used to track which certificate, key, or keystore the JWK was created from.

### Association Types

When a JWK is created, if one of the following source types is selected, the relationship is automatically created:

| Source Type | Associated Source | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Convert from Keystore** | Keystore | JWK is created by converting from the specified keystore. |
| **Convert from Public Key** | Public Key | JWK is created by converting from the specified public key. |
| **Convert from Private Key** | Private Key | JWK is created by converting from the specified private key. |
| **Convert from Certificate** | Certificate | JWK is created by converting from the specified certificate. |

### Relationship Information in JWK List

The following information is displayed for each JWK in the JWK list:

- **Creation Type**: The source type from which the JWK was created (Keystore, Certificate, Public Key, Private Key, etc.)

### Relationship Information in JWK Detail Screen

In the JWK detail screen, which source the JWK is associated with is displayed, along with the information "This JWK was created with [Source Type]".

<Info>
If there is an associated source, the source information and the option to remove the relationship are displayed in the JWK detail screen.
</Info>

## JWK Editing

JWK editing is performed through a dialog:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Editing via Dialog" icon="pencil">
    - Click **Edit** from the **⋮** menu at the end of the row in the JWK list.
    - In the opened dialog, only the JWK name and description can be edited.
    - Save the changes to update the JWK.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## JWK Deletion

To delete a JWK:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="From List Screen" icon="list">
    - Click **Delete** from the **⋮** menu at the end of the row in the JWK list.
    - Confirm the deletion operation in the confirmation dialog.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Deletion Tips" icon="info-circle">
    **Check Before Deleting:**
    - The JWK may be used in policies or connections.
    - Assign an alternative JWK if necessary.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
