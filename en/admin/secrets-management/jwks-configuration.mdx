## Basic Fields

The fields used for JSON Web Keypair creation configuration are shown in the table below.

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Name**  | A name can be written to facilitate the use and management of the JWK. |
| **Description**  | A description can be written to facilitate the use and management of the JWK. |
| **JWK Type** _(Source of JWK)_ | Specifies from which source the JWK will be created. The types that can be selected are:<br/>• Generate<br/>• Receive via URL Connection<br/>• Paste from Clipboard<br/>• Convert from Keystore<br/>• Convert from Public Key<br/>• Convert from Private Key<br/>• Convert from Certificate |

## Configuration Fields by JWK Type

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Generate">
If the JWK creation type **Generate** is selected, the following fields become active:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Key Type** _(Key Type)_ | Specifies what type the JWK to be created is:<br/>• RSA: RFC 3447 (Public-Key Cryptography Standards PKCS)<br/>• EC: Elliptic Curve (DSS)<br/>• OCT: Octet Sequence (Symmetric Key)<br/>• OKP: Octet Key Pair (RFC 8037)<br/><br/>Algorithms/curve values vary according to these values. |
| **Key Use Type** _(Key Use)_ | Specifies whether the JWK will be used for signing/signature verification or encryption/decryption. |
| **Key Size** _(Key Size)_ | The length of the key to be created in bytes. |
| **Curve** | The curve type of the JWK to be created. |
| **Algorithm** _(Algorithm)_ | The algorithm of the JWK to be created. |
| **Key Id** _(Key Id)_ | Specifies how the id of the JWK to be created will be generated. |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Receive via URL Connection">
If the JWK creation type **Receive via URL Connection** is selected, the following fields become active:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **URL** | The access address where the JWK set is located. |
| **Connect Timeout** _(Connect Timeout)_ | The connection timeout duration value in milliseconds for the connection to be made to the access address where the JWK set is located. |
| **Read Timeout** _(Read Timeout)_ | The read timeout duration value in milliseconds for the connection to be made to the access address where the JWK set is located. |
| **Size Limit** _(Size Limit)_ | The maximum size value in bytes of the data to be read from the access address where the JWK set is located. |
| **Key Id** | The id of the JWK to be obtained from the access address where the JWK set is located. Even if there are multiple JWKs at the URL address, only one definition can be made on Apinizer at the same time. |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Paste from Clipboard">
If the JWK creation type **Paste from Clipboard** is selected, the following fields become active:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **JSON Web Keypair Set** | This is the field used to enter the text version of the JWK set. |
| **Key Id** | The id of the JWK to be obtained from within the JWK set. Even if there are multiple JWKs in the text field, only one definition can be made on Apinizer at the same time. |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Convert from Keystore">
If the JWK creation type **Convert from Keystore** is selected, the following fields become active:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Key Store** | Used to specify from which keystore the JWK will be created. |
| **Environment From** | Used to specify from which environment the JWK to be created will be created. |
| **Key Store Algorithm** _(Key Store Algorithm)_ | Used to specify the algorithm of the JWK to be created from the keystore. |
| **Alias** _(Alias)_ | The Key Id value of the JWK to be created is obtained from here. |
| **Use Type** _(Use Type)_ | Specifies whether the JWK will be used for signing/signature verification or encryption/decryption. |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Convert from Public Key">
If the JWK creation type **Convert from Public Key** is selected, the following fields become active:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Public Key** _(Public Key)_ | Used to specify from which key the JWK will be created. |
| **Environment From** | Used to specify from which environment the JWK to be created will be created. |
| **Key Store Algorithm** _(Key Store Algorithm)_ | Used to specify the algorithm of the JWK to be created from the Public Key. |
| **Use Type** _(Use Type)_ | Specifies whether the JWK will be used for signing/signature verification or encryption/decryption. |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Convert from Private Key">
If the JWK creation type **Convert from Private Key** is selected, the following fields become active:

| Field | Description |
|------|----------|
| **Private Key** _(Private Key)_ | Used to specify from which key the JWK will be created. |
| **Environment From** | Used to specify from which environment the JWK to be created will be created. |
