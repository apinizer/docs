## Endpoints

- [List Projects](/api-reference/projects/list-projects) - Get all projects accessible by the authenticated user

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using a Personal API Access Token.

## Permissions

Users can only access projects where they are members. The API automatically filters projects based on the authenticated user's permissions.
