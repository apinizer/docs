## Add Policy

**Not Supported:** This policy cannot be added manually using the Add Policy endpoint. It is automatically created and added to the API Proxy when SOAP/REST transformation is enabled during API Proxy creation.

To enable this policy, configure SOAP/REST transformation settings when creating a new API Proxy.

---

## Update Policy

**Currently Not Implemented:** Update functionality for this policy is not yet implemented. While the policy can be viewed in the API Proxy, modifications cannot be made through the API at this time.

### Endpoint

```plaintext
PUT /apiops/projects/{projectName}/apiProxies/{apiProxyName}/policies/{policyName}/
```

**Note:** This endpoint exists but update functionality is not currently implemented. Future versions may support updating this policy.

---

## Delete Policy

**Not Supported:** This policy cannot be deleted. It is automatically managed by the system and is tied to the SOAP/REST transformation configuration of the API Proxy. To remove this policy, you would need to disable SOAP/REST transformation in the API Proxy configuration.

---

## Policy Condition

Policy condition allows you to specify when this policy should be applied. See [Policy Condition Documentation](/api-reference/policies/crud/add-policy) for detailed information.

---

## Error Messages

Error messages allow you to customize error responses when policy validation fails. See [Error Messages Documentation](/api-reference/policies/crud/add-policy) for detailed information.
