## Notes and Warnings

- **Credential Requirements**:
  - Credential must exist
  - Operation succeeds even if no JWK is currently assigned for decryption and encryption

- **Automatic Deployment**:
  - Credential is automatically deployed to all environments after JWK removal
  - Deployment results are returned in the response

- **No Impact on JWK**:
  - The JWK itself is not deleted
  - Only the assignment to the credential is removed

- **Impact on JWT Operations**:
  - Removing JWK may affect JWT decryption and encryption operations
  - Ensure alternative JWK is configured if needed

## Permissions

- User must have **`IDENTITY` + `MANAGE`** permission in the project
- For automatic deployment, user must also have **`IDENTITY` + `DEPLOY_UNDEPLOY`** permission
