## Notes and Warnings

- **JWK Requirements**:
  - JWK must exist in the project or admin project
  - JWK name is case-sensitive

- **Credential Requirements**:
  - Credential must exist

- **Replacement Behavior**:
  - Assigning a new JWK replaces any existing JWK for validation and signing
  - Previous JWK assignment is automatically removed

- **Usage**:
  - JWK is used for JWT signature verification
  - JWK is used for token signing operations
  - Separate from JWK used for decryption and encryption

- **Automatic Deployment**:
  - Credential is automatically deployed to all environments after JWK assignment
  - Deployment results are returned in the response

## Permissions

- User must have **`IDENTITY` + `MANAGE`** permission in the project
- For automatic deployment, user must also have **`IDENTITY` + `DEPLOY_UNDEPLOY`** permission
