## Notes and Warnings

  - Credential must exist
  - Operation succeeds even if no truststore is currently assigned

- **Automatic Deployment**:
  - Credential is automatically deployed to all environments after truststore removal
  - Deployment results are returned in the response

- **No Impact on Truststore**:
  - The truststore itself is not deleted
  - Only the assignment to the credential is removed

- **mTLS Impact**:
  - Removing truststore may affect mTLS connections
  - Ensure alternative truststore is configured if needed

## Permissions
