## Notes and Warnings

- **Private Key Requirements**:
  - Private key must exist in the project or admin project
  - Key must be of type `PRIVATE_KEY`
  - Key name is case-sensitive

- **Credential Requirements**:
  - Credential must exist
  - Credential must be in the same project or accessible from the project

- **Replacement Behavior**:
  - Assigning a new private key replaces any existing private key
  - Previous private key assignment is automatically removed

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Private keys are sensitive and should be handled securely
  - Ensure proper access controls are in place

- **Automatic Deployment**:
  - Credential is automatically deployed to all environments after private key assignment
  - Deployment results are returned in the response

## Permissions

- User must have **`IDENTITY` + `MANAGE`** permission in the project
- For automatic deployment, user must also have **`IDENTITY` + `DEPLOY_UNDEPLOY`** permission
