## Notes and Warnings

- **Permanent Deletion**:
  - Keystore is permanently deleted
  - This action cannot be undone

- **Automatic Undeployment**:
  - Keystore is automatically undeployed from all environments
  - Undeployment results are returned in the response

- **Referenced JWKs**:
  - If `jwkDeleteAction=NULLIFY` or not provided (default), JWK references will be cleared
  - If `jwkDeleteAction=DELETE`, all JWKs created from this keystore will be permanently deleted
  - Default behavior (`NULLIFY`) preserves JWKs but removes their reference to the deleted keystore

## Permissions

User must have **`SECRETS` + `MANAGE`** permission in the project. For undeployment operations (when undeploying keystores from environments), user must also have **`SECRETS` + `DEPLOY_UNDEPLOY`** permission.
